    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION: Output keeps same dims (10x10); objects preserved but their colors are permuted (1:1, no scaling).\n\n2. PATTERN: The four main L-shaped objects swap colors in two disjoint pairs; the small 2x2 legend and background remain unchanged.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: colors 1?3 swapped; 2?8 swapped; legend unchanged.\n- Ex2: colors 4?2 swapped; 7?3 swapped; legend unchanged.\n- Ex3: colors 9?4 swapped; 7?6 swapped; legend unchanged.\n\nStage 1: puzzle = color-permutation among four objects; visual: four L-shapes keep shape/position, only colors swap; grid: legend/top-left unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Same: 10x10, same four L-shaped objects in same positions and a 2x2 color key at cells (0,0)-(1,1).\n- Different: the actual color numbers vary. Pairs in inputs: ex1 (1,3) & (2,8); ex2 (4,2) & (3,7); ex3 (9,4) & (7,6).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same in all outputs: the 2x2 key (unchanged), object shapes and positions. Only colors permuted.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: swap the two top-row key colors everywhere, and swap the two bottom-row key colors everywhere. (e.g. ex1: 1?3 and 2?8; ex2: 4?2 and 3?7; ex3: 9?4 and 7?6.)\n\nReference objects: The fixed 2x2 color key at (0,0)-(1,1) stays identical and encodes the color mapping: each row defines a swap pair (left?right).\n\nGrid pattern: Dimensions and object geometry/positions are preserved. The transformation is a global color permutation: for every cell, if its color equals a key color, replace it with its paired color from the same key row.\n\nObjects: The four L-shaped connected objects repeat across examples; they are the primary actors and are recolored by the key's two horizontal swaps.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a cell is at one of the four key positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), or (1,1) THEN leave that cell's color unchanged.  \n2. Step 2: IF a cell's color is equal to the color at cell (0,0) THEN change that cell's color to the color at cell (0,1).  \n3. Step 3: IF a cell's color is equal to the color at cell (0,1) THEN change that cell's color to the color at cell (0,0).  \n4. Step 4: IF a cell's color is equal to the color at cell (1,0) THEN change that cell's color to the color at cell (1,1).  \n5. Step 5: IF a cell's color is equal to the color at cell (1,1) THEN change that cell's color to the color at cell (1,0).  \n6. Step 6: IF a cell's color is not equal to any of the four key colors (the values at (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)) and the cell is not one of the four key positions THEN leave the cell's color unchanged.\n",
