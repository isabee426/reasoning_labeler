    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Input scaled by factor 3 in each dimension (2×2 → 6×6), i.e. a 3×3 tiling of the 2×2 block.\n\n2. PATTERN: Build a 3×3 grid of the input block where tile-rows alternate: tile-row0 and tile-row2 are the input copied, tile-row1 is the input horizontally flipped. This rule fits both examples.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: Colors {7,9;4,3} tiled; middle tile-row flips horizontally (rows become [9,7]/[3,4]); other tile-rows keep original.\n- Ex2: Colors {8,6;6,4} tiled; middle tile-row flips horizontally (rows [6,8]/[4,6]); others unchanged.\n\nStage1 per example:\n- Ex1: puzzle type: tiling+flip. Visual: 3×3 repetition with alternating horizontal flip on row block 2. Grid: each 2×2 input becomes 2×2 tiles; tile rows 0,2 = [7,9;4,3], row1 = [9,7;3,4].\n- Ex2: puzzle type: same. Visual: same pattern with colors 8,6,4. Grid: tile rows 0,2 = [8,6;6,4], row1 = [6,8;4,6].\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nBoth inputs are 2x2 blocks. Ex1 uses colors {7,9,4,3} (all distinct). Ex2 uses {8,6,6,4} (6 appears twice at top-right and bottom-left).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nBoth outputs are 6x6 (=3x3 tiling of the 2x2). Tile-rows alternate: tile-row 0 and 2 reproduce the input block as-is; tile-row 1 reproduces the block with columns swapped. All original color values are preserved.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nTransformation: scale each dimension by 3 and tile the 2x2 block into a 3x3 grid; flip the block horizontally for every other (middle) tile-row.\n\nReference objects: the entire 2×2 input block is preserved as the motif; colors and relative positions within that block remain intact.\n\nGrid pattern: enlarge to 6×6 by a 3×3 tiling of the 2×2 block. Tile rows 0 and 2 are the original orientation; the middle tile row (row 1) is horizontally mirrored.\n\nObjects: the recurring object is the 2×2 block; tiles alternate by tile-row between original and horizontally flipped.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input grid is exactly 2x2 THEN identify this entire 2x2 block as the motif M and label its cells M(0,0), M(0,1), M(1,0), M(1,1) with their colors c00, c01, c10, c11 (each color c## is some value 0–9).\n\n2. Step 2: IF producing the transformed output THEN create an empty output grid of size 6x6 (i.e., scale each input dimension by factor 3 to produce a 3×3 tiling of 2×2 tiles).\n\n3. Step 3: IF placing a tile at tile-row tr and tile-column tc where tr ∈ {0,1,2} and tc ∈ {0,1,2} THEN the destination cells for that tile are the 2×2 block with rows dest_row = tr*2 + r and cols dest_col = tc*2 + c for r,c ∈ {0,1}.\n\n4. Step 4: IF the tile-row index tr is 0 or 2 (i.e., top or bottom tile-row) AND we are mapping a motif cell at relative (r,c) THEN set source coordinates (r_src, c_src) = (r, c) and copy the color from M(r_src,c_src) into output(dest_row = tr*2 + r, dest_col = tc*2 + c).\n\n5. Step 5: IF the tile-row index tr is 1 (i.e., the middle tile-row) AND we are mapping a motif cell at relative (r,c) THEN set source coordinates (r_src, c_src) = (r, 1 - c) (horizontal flip of the motif) and copy the color from M(r_src,c_src) into output(dest_row = tr*2 + r, dest_col = tc*2 + c).\n\n6. Step 6: IF a motif cell M(r_src,c_src) has color X (where X is any integer 0–9) THEN when copying that motif cell according to Steps 3–5 place the same color X unchanged into every destination cell that maps from that motif cell.\n\n7. Step 7: IF all tiles for tr ∈ {0,1,2} and tc ∈ {0,1,2} have been filled by Steps 3–6 THEN the final output is the 6x6 grid consisting of a 3×3 tiling of the original 2×2 motif where tile-rows 0 and 2 reproduce the motif orientation and tile-row 1 reproduces the motif with columns swapped (horizontal mirror).\n",
