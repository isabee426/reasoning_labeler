    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Split along the horizontal cyan stripe (color 7); output is a 6x4 block (one side of the stripe) so input 13x4 -> output 6x4 (consistent).\n\n2. PATTERN: For each task pick the half (above or below the color-7 row) that has more nonzero cells, copy that 6x4 half, keep 0 as background, and recolor its nonzero foreground (2 or 6) to color 8.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- EX1: bottom half chosen; all 6 -> 8; 0 preserved.\n- EX2: top half chosen; all 2 -> 8; 0 preserved.\n- EX3: bottom half chosen; all 6 -> 8; 0 preserved.\n- EX4: bottom half chosen; all 6 -> 8; 0 preserved.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT ===\nAll inputs are split by the cyan stripe (color 7) into two 6x4 halves. The top half uses color 2, the bottom half uses color 6; background is 0.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT ===\nAll outputs are 6x4 and use only colors 0 and 8. Each output is a single half extracted and recolored entirely to 8 (no other colors remain).\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT ===\nRule: compare the two 6x4 halves; pick the half with fewer nonzero cells, keep its pattern, recolor its nonzero cells to 8, set every other cell to 0.\n\n1. REFERENCE OBJECTS:\n- The horizontal cyan stripe (color 7) is fixed and always splits the 13x4 grid into two 6x4 halves. It guides the cut; everything above is the \"top half\" reference.\n\n2. GRID PATTERNS:\n- Always split on the cyan row into two 6x4 blocks. The transformation picks the top block (contains color 2 in all examples), maps its filled pixels to color 8, and outputs that 6x4 block.\n\n3. OBJECTS:\n- Recurring objects are the connected colored blobs (top: color 2, bottom: color 6). The top connected pattern is the one preserved, recolored to 8; relative layout/shape is maintained.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF there exists a row in the input where every cell in that row is color 7 THEN identify that row as the splitter and mark the cells above it as the \"top 6x4 block\" and the cells below it as the \"bottom 6x4 block\".\n\n2. Step 2: IF a \"top 6x4 block\" and a \"bottom 6x4 block\" have been identified THEN treat each block independently and compute count_top = number of cells in the top block whose color is not 0 and count_bottom = number of cells in the bottom block whose color is not 0.\n\n3. Step 3: IF count_top > count_bottom THEN set the selected block = the top 6x4 block.\n\n4. Step 4: IF count_bottom > count_top THEN set the selected block = the bottom 6x4 block.\n\n5. Step 5: IF count_top == count_bottom THEN set the selected block = the top 6x4 block (tie-break rule).\n\n6. Step 6: IF a block has been selected THEN create the output as that selected 6x4 block with the following atomic pixel action: for every cell in the selected block IF the cell color is 0 THEN keep it 0 ELSE change its color to 8.\n\n7. Step 7: IF the output has been created from the selected block THEN present exactly that 6x4 grid (no rotation, no mirroring, no further translation or padding) as the final output.\n",
