    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: All cases 7x7 -> 7x7 (ratio 1:1).  \n2. PATTERN: Take the three nonzero colors along the diagonal/staircase, form a 3-color cycle, and tile the whole grid so cell = cycle[(row+col) mod 3].  \n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: colors {1,2,4} → cycle [2,4,1] tiled; zeros filled.\n- Ex2: colors {2,8,3} → cycle [2,8,3] tiled.\n- Ex3: colors {4,8,3} → cycle [4,8,3] tiled.\n\nStage1: puzzle = extract 3-color diagonal motif and repeat as period-3 checkerboard.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Same: all are 7x7 with a 3-color staircase/diagonal of nonzero colors and otherwise 0.\n- Diff: staircase position/orientation and which color numbers appear (ex1: {1,2,4}, ex2: {2,8,3}, ex3: {8,3,4}); ex3 also has a separate short yellow run but still uses three core colors.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly the same: a full 7x7 periodic 3-color tiling repeating every 3 cells in both axes; each row is a cyclic rotation. The three colors used equal the input staircase colors.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: read the three staircase colors in order (top-left → bottom-right), form a 3-cycle, tile the 7x7 so out[r,c] = cycle[(r+c) mod 3]. This rule fits all examples.\n\nREFERENCE OBJECTS:\n- The 3-color connected staircase/diagonal is preserved. Its color order (reading from the top-left end of the staircase to the bottom-right end) is the reference cycle.\n\nGRID PATTERNS:\n- Fill the entire 7x7 by repeating that 3-color cycle. Cell (r,c) = cycle[(r+c) mod 3], producing the shown checker/diagonal tiling.\n\nOBJECTS:\n- Only the 3-color staircase matters; background 0s are ignored. The staircase supplies the ordered triad used to tile every cell.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF the input grid is 7x7 THEN proceed to build a period-3 tiling based on (row+col) mod 3 (do not change grid size).\n\nStep 2: IF a cell's color is nonzero (color != 0) THEN compute r = (row + col) mod 3 and record the mapping remainder r -> that cell's color (if no color is recorded yet for remainder r).\n\nStep 3: IF two or more nonzero cells produce mappings to the same remainder r but with different colors THEN choose as the recorded color for remainder r the color that appears most frequently among cells whose (row+col) mod 3 = r (if there is a tie choose the smaller numeric color).\n\nStep 4: IF after scanning the grid there is a recorded color for each remainder 0, 1, and 2 THEN define the ordered cycle C as [color_for_remainder_0, color_for_remainder_1, color_for_remainder_2].\n\nStep 5: IF some remainder r has no recorded color after scanning (no nonzero cell with that (row+col) mod 3) THEN assign that remainder a color chosen from the set of nonzero colors present in the grid that is not yet used in the cycle (if multiple choices remain, choose the smallest numeric color) so that C has three colors.\n\nStep 6: IF the cycle C = [c0,c1,c2] is defined THEN for every grid cell at (row, col) set its color to c_{(row+col) mod 3} (i.e., replace all cells, including zeros and any other marks, with the periodic tiling).\n\nStep 7: IF the above filling is applied THEN the resulting grid is a full 7x7 tiling where each cell color equals the cycle entry indexed by (row+col) mod 3, which preserves the input's remainder->color assignments on the original staircase positions.\n",
