    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Input and output are same size (10x10) in all examples; ratio 1:1.\n\n2. PATTERN: There are three single colored pixels in row0; they recolor the three distinct connected regions of color 5. Mapping is left-to-right: the leftmost top pixel's color fills the leftmost 5-region, the middle top pixel fills the middle 5-region, the rightmost top pixel fills the rightmost 5-region. Other pixels unchanged.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 5-regions -> left=1, middle/bottom=4, right=7; row0 and 0 stay same.\n- Ex2: 5-regions -> left=2, center=6, right=8; row0 and 0 stay same.\n- Ex3: 5-regions -> left=1, center=6, right=7; row0 and 0 stay same.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Same: 10x10; three single-pixel markers in row0; multiple connected regions of color 5 (three distinct regions); background 0.\n- Different: marker colors/columns vary (examples use top colors {1,4,7}, {2,6,8}, {1,6,7}); shapes/sizes/positions of the 5-regions differ.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: row0 unchanged; each distinct 5-region is recolored (not moved) to a top-row marker color; background 0 unchanged; left/mid/right region map preserved.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule that fits all: For each connected region of color 5, replace every 5 with the color of the single pixel in row0 whose column lies above that region (left region→left top color, middle→middle top color, right→right top color).\n\nReference objects: the three single-pixel markers in row0 stay the same and supply the target colors. They guide recoloring.\n\nGrid pattern: for every example, each distinct connected region of color 5 is recolored to the color of the corresponding top-row marker by left→middle→right order. All shapes, positions and other colors remain unchanged.\n\nObjects: key objects are the three top markers and the three color-5 blocks; mapping is horizontal rank; only color of 5-blocks changes.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a cell is in row 0 AND that cell forms a 1-cell connected component (i.e., it has color C and none of its 4-neighbors share that color) THEN classify that cell as a top-row single-pixel marker and record its column and its color C.\n\nStep 2: IF a connected region (4-connected) of cells has color 5 THEN classify that region as a color-5 object (each distinct 4-connected region is a separate object).\n\nStep 3: IF there are exactly three color-5 objects THEN sort these three color-5 objects by their minimum column coordinate (min_col) in ascending order and label them left-region, middle-region, right-region.\n\nStep 4: IF there are exactly three top-row single-pixel markers THEN sort these three markers by their column in ascending order and label them left-marker, middle-marker, right-marker and record left-marker color CL, middle-marker color CM, right-marker color CR.\n\nStep 5: IF an object is the left-region (a color-5 object identified in Step 3) THEN change every cell of that object from color 5 to color CL (the color of the left-marker).\n\nStep 6: IF an object is the middle-region (a color-5 object identified in Step 3) THEN change every cell of that object from color 5 to color CM (the color of the middle-marker).\n\nStep 7: IF an object is the right-region (a color-5 object identified in Step 3) THEN change every cell of that object from color 5 to color CR (the color of the right-marker).\n\nStep 8: IF a cell is not part of any color-5 object OR is a top-row single-pixel marker THEN leave that cell's color unchanged.\n",
