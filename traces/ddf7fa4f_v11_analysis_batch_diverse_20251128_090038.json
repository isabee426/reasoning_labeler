    "raw_analysis": "TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Same 10x10 output; each connected region of color 5 is recolored (no shape/position changes), mapping to a top-row singleton color above it.\n\nPATTERN: For every distinct 5-region, take its horizontal span, find the nonzero pixel in row 0 whose column lies inside that span, and replace the entire 5-region with that pixel's color; background and row-0 pixels stay.\n\nKEY CHANGES:\nEx1: 5-regions -> cols0-3 =1, cols7-9 =7, middle bottom cols3-6 =4; row0 and 0 unchanged.\nEx2: 5-regions -> left cols1-2 =2, center cols4-7 =6, bottom-right cols7-9 =8; row0/0 unchanged.\nEx3: 5-regions -> left cols1-2 =1, center-bottom cols3-5 =6, right cols7-9 =7; row0/0 unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs: three singletons in row0 at different columns (colors differ: ex1 {1,4,7}, ex2 {2,6,8}, ex3 {1,6,7}). Each input contains three distinct connected regions of color 5; shapes and positions vary.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All outputs preserve non-5 pixels exactly. Every 5-region keeps its shape/position but is recolored to one of the row0 singleton colors.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: for each connected 5-region, replace color 5 by the color of the row0 singleton whose column intersects that region’s horizontal span (ex1: left 5→1, right 5→7, bottom 5→4).\n\n1) REFERENCE OBJECTS: The three colored singletons in row 0 are fixed anchors; their colors provide the palette and left-to-right ordering for the mapping.\n\n2) GRID PATTERN: Every connected region of color 5 is recolored (no shape/pos change). Map regions to the top singletons by horizontal order: leftmost 5-region → left singleton color, middle → middle, rightmost → right.\n\n3) OBJECTS: Most important are the three row-0 singletons and each distinct connected 5-region; there are three of each and ordering is by x-coordinate.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a connected region is entirely within row 0 AND its size is 1 AND its color ≠ 0 THEN mark that region as an anchor with its column index and its color.  \n2. Step 2: IF a connected region's color is 5 THEN determine that region's horizontal span by computing its minimum column index min_col and maximum column index max_col.  \n3. Step 3: IF a connected region's color is 5 AND there is exactly one anchor whose column c satisfies min_col ≤ c ≤ max_col THEN change the color of every cell in that connected color-5 region to the anchor's color.  \n4. Step 4: IF a connected region's color is 5 AND more than one anchor has a column c that satisfies min_col ≤ c ≤ max_col THEN choose the anchor with the smallest column index (leftmost anchor) and change the color of every cell in that connected color-5 region to that anchor's color.  \n5. Step 5: IF a connected region's color is 5 AND no anchor has a column c that satisfies min_col ≤ c ≤ max_col THEN find the anchor whose column is nearest in horizontal distance to the region (break ties by choosing the leftmost anchor) and change the color of every cell in that connected color-5 region to that anchor's color.  \n6. Step 6: IF a pixel is not part of a connected region of color 5 THEN do not change that pixel's color.  \n7. Step 7: IF a pixel is an anchor in row 0 (connected region of size 1 in row 0) THEN preserve that pixel's original color (do not recolor it).\n",
