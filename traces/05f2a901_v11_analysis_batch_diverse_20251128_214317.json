    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Input and output grids keep same dimensions (ratio 1:1); the change is a rigid translation of one object.\n\n2. PATTERN: In every case the color-2 shape is translated (no rotation/flip) along the shortest vector so it becomes orthogonally adjacent (touching side-to-side) to the color-8 2x2 block; color-8 and background remain fixed.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: color 2 shifted right by +3 cols to touch color 8; color 8 unchanged.\n- Ex2: color 2 shifted down by +6 rows to touch color 8; color 8 unchanged.\n- Ex3: color 2 shifted up by -3 rows to touch color 8; color 8 unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Color-2 shape is the same shape/size in all inputs. Color-8 is always a 2x2 block. What differs: absolute positions and relative placement (2 can be above, below, or left of 8).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Color-8 is unchanged in every output (same bbox). Color-2 keeps shape/orientation. In all outputs 2 is placed immediately adjacent (touching) 8.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Transform: rigidly translate color-2 toward color-8 (along the vector between their centers) until 2 becomes adjacent to 8; leave color-8 unchanged.\n\n1) Reference: the 2x2 color-8 block is fixed and used as anchor. The color-2 shape's form stays identical and guides where to move.  \n2) Grid pattern: rigid translation of the color-2 object toward the color-8 block along the shortest Manhattan direction until they become adjacent (touching), keeping orientation.  \n3) Objects: recurring: a 2x2 color-8 anchor and a larger irregular color-2 object; these two determine the move.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF an object exists whose color is 8 and whose occupied cells form exactly a filled 2x2 square (bounding box 2x2 and all four cells color is 8) THEN designate that object as the anchor and do not change its cells or position.\n\n2. Step 2: IF a connected region exists whose color is 2 (any shape or size) THEN designate that connected region as the movable object and preserve its exact pixel pattern and orientation (do not rotate or flip any pixels of color 2).\n\n3. Step 3: IF the color-2 connected region is already orthogonally adjacent to the color-8 2x2 anchor (i.e., at least one color-2 cell shares a side with a color-8 cell) THEN leave the color-2 region in place (no movement).\n\n4. Step 4: IF the color-2 connected region is not orthogonally adjacent to the color-8 2x2 anchor THEN determine the single cardinal direction (up OR down OR left OR right) and minimal positive integer distance n such that translating the entire color-2 region rigidly by n units in that single cardinal direction produces at least one side-adjacency between a color-2 cell and a color-8 cell while causing no color-2 cell to overlap a color-8 cell, THEN translate the entire color-2 region rigidly by exactly n units in that cardinal direction (preserving all color-2 pixels).\n\n5. Step 5: IF translating the color-2 region by the minimal n in any single cardinal direction would cause overlap with color-8 (i.e., the minimal move that reaches the anchor would overlap) THEN reduce the translation so that the color-2 region stops one unit before overlap and is side-adjacent to color-8 (i.e., enforce adjacency without overlap).\n\n6. Step 6: IF there are multiple distinct connected regions of color 2 in the input THEN apply Steps 2-5 only to the single largest connected region by cell count (leave all smaller color-2 regions unchanged).\n\n7. Step 7: IF a cell's color is not 2 or 8 (for example color 0 background) THEN leave that cell unchanged (do not create, delete, or recolor background or other colors).\n",
