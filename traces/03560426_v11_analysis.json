    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Input and output are same size (10x10) in all examples (ratio 1:1).\n\n2) PATTERN: Identify each distinct colored connected block (bottom row cluster), preserve its shape/color and move blocks to the top-left in left→right order, placing them in a down-right diagonal (stair) so each subsequent block touches the previous by corner.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 8(3x3),7(2x2),2(2x3) moved to TL: 8→rows0-2 cols0-2; 7→rows3-4 cols2-3; 2→rows4-5 cols3-5; 0 stays background.\n- Ex2: 1(3x2),2(2x2),3(2x2),4(4x1) moved TL in order: 1 top-left, then 2,3,4 down-right; 0 unchanged.\n- Ex3: 4(2x4),2(5x1 vertical),3(3x3) moved TL: 4→rows0-1 cols0-3; 2→col3 rows1-5; 3→rows5-7 cols3-5; background 0 unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs 10x10.\n- Each has several distinct connected colored blocks clustered in bottom rows. Ex1 colors {8,7,2}; Ex2 {1,2,3,4}; Ex3 {4,2,3}.\n- Left-to-right order of blocks differs per example.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All outputs contain the same colors moved to the top-left, arranged as a diagonal/staircase packing; remaining cells are 0.\n- No new colors; all original colors appear.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: take each connected block (left-to-right) and translate it (keep its color, approximate shape) into top-left, stacking them diagonally so blocks abut to form a staircase.\n\n- Reference objects: the leftmost colored connected block becomes the anchor (moved to top-left). All other blocks keep their left-to-right order relative to that anchor; colors and shapes are preserved.\n\n- Grid pattern: sort objects by increasing original column (left→right). Tile them into the top-left corner in that order, forming a diagonal \"staircase\" (each next block placed down-and-right touching the previous at a corner), no rotation.\n\n- Objects: the distinct colored connected blocks (rectangular clusters) are the key recurring items; their sizes/orientations are preserved and determine spacing.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a cell's color is not 0 and that cell is part of a connected region of same-colored cells (a distinct object) THEN identify that connected region as an object and record its bounding box [min_row, min_col, height, width], preserving its exact shape and color (no rotation or color change).\n\nStep 2: IF there are two or more identified objects THEN sort all objects by increasing bounding-box min_col (leftmost position); if two objects have the same min_col THEN sort those by increasing min_row (higher-up first).\n\nStep 3: IF an object is the first object in the sorted left-to-right order THEN move that object's bounding box so its top-left cell is placed at (row=0, col=0) in the output, copying every object cell to the corresponding offset location and leaving its shape and color unchanged.\n\nStep 4: IF an object is the next object in the sorted order after a previously placed object THEN place this object at the smallest output coordinates (r,c) (minimize r, then c) such that (a) placing the object's bounding box with its original shape at (r,c) causes no cell overlap with any already placed object and (b) at least one cell of this object will be diagonally adjacent (touching by a corner) to at least one cell of the immediately previous placed object; copy all its cells at that (r,c) offset, preserving shape and color and not rotating.\n\nStep 5: IF no (r,c) exists that satisfies both non-overlap and diagonal-corner-touch to the immediately previous object THEN place the object at the smallest (r,c) (minimize r, then c) such that it does not overlap any already placed object and it shares at least one edge-adjacent cell with the immediately previous placed object; copy all cells at that offset, preserving shape and color and not rotating.\n\nStep 6: IF multiple candidate positions satisfy the chosen touching condition (diagonal preferred, else edge) THEN choose the candidate with the smallest row index r, and if rows tie choose the one with the smallest column index c.\n\nStep 7: IF all objects from the input have been placed following Steps 3–6 THEN set every remaining unassigned cell in the output grid to color 0 (background).\n\nStep 8: IF an input contains only background (no nonzero objects) THEN produce an output identical to the input (all zeros).\n",
