    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Output same dimensions; the orange (5) grid lines stay; each 3x3 tile between lines is replaced by a single uniform color.\n\n2. PATTERN: For every input tile the solver picks one cell inside that 3x3 and fills the whole tile with that cell's color (same positional rule applied to all tiles across all examples).\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: nine tiles become [0,3,0; 0,6,4; 2,0,0] (rows) replacing varied colors with these single colors; grid lines (5) unchanged.\n- Ex2: tiles -> [0,0,2; 0,3,0; 4,0,6]; separators unchanged.\n- Ex3: tiles -> [0,4,0; 0,2,6; 0,3,0]; separators unchanged.\n- Ex4: tiles -> [2,0,0; 0,4,3; 6,0,0]; separators unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs share the same orange cross (color 5) at rows/cols 3 and 7, creating nine 3x3 tiles. Tile contents vary in colors (0-8).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Every output preserves the orange cross unchanged. Each 3x3 tile between the lines is filled uniformly with a single color. Tile sizes/positions are identical across outputs.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: for each 3x3 input tile, replace it by one color that already appears somewhere inside that same tile (the solver picks one existing tile color and fills the tile).\n\n1) REFERENCE: The orange cross (color 5) at cols/rows 3 and 7 is invariant and defines nine 3x3 tiles -- it anchors the transformation.\n\n2) GRID PATTERN: For every example, each 3x3 tile (the cell blocks between orange lines) is replaced by a single uniform color. That color is taken from the tile's existing colors (effectively the modal/non-black color).\n\n3) OBJECTS: Key objects = the orange grid lines and the nine 3x3 tiles. Recurring pattern = colorful clusters inside tiles; black is background and ignored.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a cell's color is 5 (orange) THEN leave that cell unchanged (do not modify any orange line pixel).\n\nStep 2: IF a 3x3 region is one of the nine blocks defined by the orange cross (i.e., a 3x3 block whose rows are {0-2,4-6,8-10} and whose cols are {0-2,4-6,8-10}) THEN treat that 3x3 as a single object to be recolored (do not change individual cells independently).\n\nStep 3: IF the 3x3 block contains at least one color that is neither 5 nor 0 and there exists a color in that block (not 5, not 0) that occurs exactly once in the block THEN change every cell of that 3x3 block to that uniquely occurring non-0, non-5 color.\n\nStep 4: IF the 3x3 block contains one or more colors that are neither 5 nor 0 but no such color occurs exactly once, THEN change every cell of that 3x3 block to the non-5 color that has the highest frequency within that block (if there is a tie between non-5 colors, choose the tied color whose first occurrence in reading order -- top row left-to-right, then next rows -- appears earliest).\n\nStep 5: IF the 3x3 block contains no non-5 colors (i.e., it contains only 0s and 5s) THEN change every non-5 cell of that 3x3 block to color 0 (so the whole 3x3 becomes uniform color 0).\n\nStep 6: IF any cell lies on an orange line intersection or orange line (color 5) AND also would be changed by the block recoloring rule above THEN do not change it (orange lines are always preserved even when a block adjacent to them is recolored).\n",
