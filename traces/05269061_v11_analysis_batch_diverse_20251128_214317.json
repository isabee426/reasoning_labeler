    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Input and output sizes are identical (7x7 -> 7x7); the grid is replaced by a full 2D periodic tiling (size ratio 1:1).\n\n2. PATTERN: All examples extract the three colored cells on the short diagonal (order along the NW-SE diagonal) and tile the entire grid so value = sequence[(row+col) mod 3].\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: diagonal = [2,4,1]; zeros become the repeating pattern.\n- Ex2: diagonal = [2,8,3]; sparse corner copied into full repeat.\n- Ex3: diagonal = [4,8,3]; both diagonals' colors used and tiled.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT ===\n- Differences: the 3 colored cells differ in position and orientation (corner/diagonal/location); Ex3 has a second small 4-chain.\n- Same: each input contains exactly three key nonzero colors arranged contiguously (a short diagonal/L) e.g. Ex1 {1,2,4}, Ex2 {2,8,3}, Ex3 {4,8,3}.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT ===\n- Exactly the same: a 7x7 full periodic tiling repeating a 3-color cycle. Rows are cyclic shifts; only the three extracted colors appear.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT ===\n- Rule: read the ordered 3-color sequence from the contiguous colored line in the input (from its upper/left extreme along the chain) and tile that 3-cycle across the entire 7x7 grid.\n\nReference objects: the small connected diagonal chain of three distinct colors (and any extra small same-color chain) is the anchor. Its ordered sequence defines the 3-color cycle.\n\nGrid pattern: tile the 3-color cycle periodically across the full 7x7 (period 3 in both axes) to form a 2D repeating pattern.\n\nObjects: the 3-color diagonal is most important; extra isolated same-color pieces fix the cycle's phase. Phase is chosen so all original colored cells keep their colors.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF there exist three cells at positions (r,c), (r+1,c+1), (r+2,c+2) (0-based indices) whose colors are all nonzero and pairwise distinct (i.e., a contiguous NW-SE 3-cell diagonal) THEN record r0 = r, c0 = c and define the ordered 3-color sequence S = [color(r0,c0), color(r0+1,c0+1), color(r0+2,c0+2)].\n\n2. Step 2: IF more than one distinct contiguous NW-SE 3-cell diagonal exists in the input THEN choose the diagonal with the smallest r value and, if tied, the smallest c value, and set r0,c0 and S according to that chosen diagonal.\n\n3. Step 3: IF S and (r0,c0) are defined AND the grid is 7x7 THEN for every cell at coordinates (i,j) (0-based) set its color to S[((i - r0) + (j - c0)) mod 3] (i.e., tile S periodically with period 3 in both axes, with the top-left of the chosen diagonal as the phase anchor).\n\n4. Step 4: IF after applying Step 3 any original input cell that had a nonzero color does not match that original color in the generated tiling THEN rotate S cyclically (replace S by [S2,S0,S1] or [S1,S2,S0]) and reapply Step 3; repeat at most two rotations until all original nonzero input cells match their colors.\n\n5. Step 5: IF the above produces a consistent 7x7 assignment matching all original nonzero cells THEN output the full 7x7 grid given by that 3-color periodic tiling (replace the entire input grid with the tiled pattern).\n",
