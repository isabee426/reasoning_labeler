Step 1: IF a pixel is in row 0 AND its color is not 0 THEN leave that pixel's color unchanged.  \n2. Step 2: IF a pixel's color is not 5 AND it is not in row 0 THEN leave that pixel's color unchanged.  \n3. Step 3: IF there exists a connected region (4-connected) whose color is 5 THEN compute that region's horizontal span [min_col, max_col] and set its horizontal center C = floor((min_col + max_col)/2).  \n4. Step 4: IF a connected region of color 5 has horizontal center C THEN consider all pixels in row 0 whose color is not 0 and compute their absolute column distance |col - C|.  \n5. Step 5: IF two or more row-0 nonzero pixels tie for the minimal distance to C THEN choose the tied pixel with the smallest column index (leftmost).  \n6. Step 6: IF a specific row-0 nonzero pixel (the nearest marker) has color X (where X ∈ {1..9}) THEN change the color of every cell in that connected region of color 5 to color X (preserving the region's shape and position).\n",
