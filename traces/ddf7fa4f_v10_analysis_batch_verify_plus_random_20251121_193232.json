    "raw_analysis": "1) Transformation type: input and output are 10x10 (1:1), no resizing.\n\n2) Pattern: each distinct connected region with color 5 is recolored to the color of the single-pixel marker in row 0 whose column overlaps that region (vertical alignment). All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\n3) Key changes:\n- Ex1: 5-region left -> 1; right -> 7; bottom -> 4; others unchanged.\n- Ex2: top-center 5 -> 6; left 5 -> 2; bottom-right 5 -> 8; others unchanged.\n- Ex3: left 5 -> 1; center 5 -> 6; right 5 -> 7; others unchanged.\n\nStage 1 summary: puzzle = recolor connected objects by vertical top-marker mapping; visual: top-row markers assign colors; grid: 5-regions mapped as above.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Same: 10x10, three single-pixel markers in row 0, multiple distinct connected regions of color 5 (three regions each).\n- Diff: marker colors/columns and the horizontal positions/shapes of the color-5 regions vary.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: row‑0 pixels and all non-5 pixels unchanged; the three 5-regions remain same shapes/locations but recolored.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: each distinct connected region of color 5 is recolored to the color of the row‑0 single pixel whose column is nearest to that region (use horizontal proximity).\n\n- Reference objects: the three single-pixel markers in row 0 stay identical and act as the palette (ordered left→middle→right by column).\n- Grid pattern: every distinct connected region of color 5 is recolored (shape/position preserved) to the color of the top-row marker whose column is nearest to that region (horizontal proximity).\n- Objects: the 5-colored connected regions (three per example) are the primary objects; mapping uses x-coordinate ordering.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a cell is in row 0 and its color is a value K where K ≠ 0 and K ≠ 5, THEN treat that cell as a top-row marker located at its column with marker color K (do not change the cell color).\n\n2. Step 2: IF one or more cells form a connected region by orthogonal adjacency (4-neighbor connectivity) and every cell in that region has color 5, THEN treat that entire connected region as a single object and compute its horizontal span [min_col, max_col] (the smallest and largest column indices occupied by the region).\n\n3. Step 3: IF a connected region of color 5 has at least one column c in the interval [min_col, max_col] such that the cell at (row=0, col=c) is a top-row marker of color K, THEN change the color of every cell in that connected region to K.\n\n4. Step 4: IF a connected region of color 5 contains columns that include more than one distinct top-row marker column (i.e., there exist marker columns c1≠c2 inside [min_col, max_col] with colors K1 and K2), THEN for each column c in the region that aligns with a top-row marker of color K, change the color of all region cells in that column to K (perform recoloring column-by-column according to the marker directly above that column).\n\n5. Step 5: IF a top-row column c is a marker of color K but no cell of any color-5 region occupies column c, THEN do nothing for that marker (leave the marker and grid unchanged).\n\n6. Step 6: IF a cell's color is not 5 and the cell is not in row 0 markers as defined in Step 1, THEN leave that cell's color unchanged.\n\n7. Step 7: IF any recoloring actions from Steps 3–4 are applied, THEN do not move or reshape any objects: preserve every cell's coordinates (only change colors).\n",
