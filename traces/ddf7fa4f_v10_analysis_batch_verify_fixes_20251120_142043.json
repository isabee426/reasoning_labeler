    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Input and output are same size (10x10), ratio 1:1.\n\n2. PATTERN: Every distinct connected region of color 5 is recolored to the color of the nearest nonzero marker in row 0 (horizontal proximity); all other pixels stay identical.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 5-regions → left block = color 1, right block = color 7, bottom rectangle = color 4; markers unchanged.\n- Ex2: 5-regions → left vertical = 2, center square = 6, bottom-right = 8; markers unchanged.\n- Ex3: 5-regions → top-left = 1, center square = 6, right block = 7; markers unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll inputs have three nonzero markers in row 0 at different columns and multiple distinct connected regions of color 5 elsewhere. Marker colors vary (e.g. {1,4,7}, {2,6,8}, {1,6,7}). Non-5 cells and shapes differ.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nRow0 and all non-5 cells are unchanged. Each 5-region keeps its shape/position but is uniformly recolored to one of the row0 marker colors.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nRule: For each connected region of 5, recolor every cell to the color of the nearest nonzero cell in row 0 by horizontal (column) distance (examples: 5->1,7,4; 5->2,6,8; 5->1,6,7).\n\nReference objects: The three single-pixel colored markers in row 0 remain unchanged and act as keys. \nGrid pattern: Recolor each DISTINCT connected region of color 5 with the color of the row‑0 markers in left→right order (match by object bbox x-position). \nObjects: Recurring: the three top markers and multiple separate color‑5 regions; background and other colors stay.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a pixel is in row 0 AND its color is not 0 AND that pixel has no 4-connected neighbor of the same color (i.e., it is a single-pixel nonzero marker in row 0) THEN mark that pixel as a key marker and leave its color unchanged.\n\n2. Step 2: IF a pixel's color is 5 THEN assign that pixel to its distinct connected region using 4-connectivity (each distinct connected region of color 5 is treated as one object) and compute that region's bounding-box leftmost column (min column index).\n\n3. Step 3: IF there are exactly three key markers in row 0 at three different columns THEN sort those three key markers by their column index from smallest to largest and record their colors as key_left_color, key_mid_color, key_right_color respectively.\n\n4. Step 4: IF a connected region of color 5 has its bounding-box min column equal to the smallest min column among all 5-regions (i.e., it is the leftmost 5-region) THEN change the color of every pixel in that connected region from 5 to key_left_color.\n\n5. Step 5: IF a connected region of color 5 has its bounding-box min column strictly between the other two regions' bounding-box min columns (i.e., it is the middle 5-region) THEN change the color of every pixel in that connected region from 5 to key_mid_color.\n\n6. Step 6: IF a connected region of color 5 has its bounding-box min column equal to the largest min column among all 5-regions (i.e., it is the rightmost 5-region) THEN change the color of every pixel in that connected region from 5 to key_right_color.\n\n7. Step 7: IF a pixel is not color 5 and is not one of the row-0 single-pixel key markers THEN leave that pixel's color unchanged.\n",
