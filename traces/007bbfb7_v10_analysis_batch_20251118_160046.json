TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Upscale 3x3 → 9x9 (factor 3); each input cell maps to a 3x3 tile: if the input cell ≠0, the tile is the entire 3x3 input pattern (colors preserved); if input cell =0, the tile is all 0.\n\n2. PATTERN: Consistent across all examples: every nonzero input cell triggers placing a copy of the full input grid into the corresponding 3x3 block of the output.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\nEx1: color6 at (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(2,1),(2,2) → those tiles = input pattern (6); others 0.\nEx2: color4 at (0,0),(0,2),(2,1) → those tiles = input pattern (4); others 0.\nEx3: color2 at (1,2),(2,0),(2,2) → those tiles = input pattern (2); others 0.\nEx4: color2 at (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(2,1),(2,2) → those tiles = input pattern (2); others 0.\nEx5: color7 at (0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2) → those tiles = input pattern (7); others 0.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs are 3x3, each has one foreground color (examples: 6,4,2,2,7). They differ only by which cells are nonzero (shape).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All outputs are 9x9, composed of 3x3 tiles. A tile at (i,j) is nonzero iff input(i,j)≠0. Every nonzero tile equals the entire 3x3 input pattern: nonzero positions filled with the input’s foreground color, zeros kept 0.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Upscale by 3: for each input cell produce a 3x3 block; if cell=0 → all 0; if cell=c≠0 → block = input’s 3x3 mask with nonzeros = c.\n\nReference objects: The 3x3 input itself (the foreground mask and its single color) is the template and reference for every placement.\n\nGrid pattern: Output is a 9x9 formed of nine 3x3 tiles (3x3 upscaling). Each input cell maps to the corresponding tile position.\n\nObjects: For each input cell: if nonzero, place a 3x3 copy of the input mask colored with that cell's color; if zero, leave the tile black. This fits all examples.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nScale the 3x3 input up to a 9x9 output by a factor of 3: each input cell at (i,j) becomes a 3x3 tile occupying rows 3*i..3*i+2 and cols 3*j..3*j+2. If the input cell = 0, its 3x3 tile is all 0. If the input cell = c (nonzero), its 3x3 tile is an exact copy of the entire 3x3 input pattern, preserving 0 positions and using color c in every nonzero position of that copied pattern. The background remains 0 and the input’s foreground color(s) are preserved in every placed tile.\n",
