    "raw_analysis": "1. Transformation type: crop/extract the single quadrant with a unique color and output its bounding box; input->output size varies (no fixed ratio).\n\n2. Pattern: among the four corner quadrants divided by black cross, the quadrant whose color is unique (appears in only that quadrant) is isolated and cropped; other quadrants removed.\n\n3. Key changes:\n- Ex1: color 3 (bottom-right) extracted; other colors removed, background 0 preserved.\n- Ex2: color 2 (bottom-left) extracted similarly.\n- Ex3: color 4 (bottom-left) extracted similarly.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Key differences: the unique quadrant color differs: ex1 uses color 3, ex2 color 2, ex3 color 4. Quadrant shapes vary.\n- What stays same: a black (0) cross separates four corner blobs; three corners share one color while one corner has a distinct color.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: each output is a tight crop (bounding box) of the single quadrant whose color is unique, with that color preserved and all other pixels set to 0.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Transformation that works for all: identify the corner quadrant whose color appears only once among the four, crop to its bounding box, keep that color, set background to 0.\n\n1) Reference objects: a black cross divider and four quadrant blobs -- three quadrants share the same color and one quadrant has a different (unique) color. The unique-colored quadrant is the cue.\n\n2) Grid pattern: locate the quadrant whose color differs from the other three, extract its minimal bounding box (crop) and output that region unchanged.\n\n3) Objects: recurring objects are the black cross (separator) and four connected quadrant blobs; the unique-colored quadrant is the most important object to crop.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF there exists at least one full row of cells all equal to color 0 and at least one full column of cells all equal to color 0 that intersect, THEN treat those intersecting row and column as the grid divider and partition the input into four corner quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) bounded by that row and column.\n\n2. Step 2: IF quadrants are defined, THEN for each quadrant compute the set of non-zero colors present in that quadrant (i.e., all colors c where c != 0 and at least one cell in the quadrant has color c).\n\n3. Step 3: IF a color value c (c != 0) appears in exactly one quadrant's set and does not appear in the other three quadrant sets, THEN mark that quadrant as the unique-colored quadrant associated with color c.\n\n4. Step 4: IF a unique-colored quadrant is marked, THEN compute the minimal axis-aligned bounding box that contains every cell in that quadrant whose color != 0 (include any interior cells of color 0 inside the box, but the box must span from the minimum to maximum row and column of non-zero cells in that quadrant).\n\n5. Step 5: IF the bounding box is computed, THEN produce the output image by copying exactly the pixels from the input that lie inside that bounding box (preserve their original color values, including 0s inside the box) and do not include any pixels outside that box.\n\n6. Step 6: IF more than one color each appears in exactly one quadrant (a tie), THEN choose the tied quadrant whose non-zero color has the largest total cell count inside its quadrant and apply Steps 4-5 to that chosen quadrant.\n\n7. Step 7: IF no non-zero color appears in exactly one quadrant (no unique quadrant found), THEN output a grid consisting only of color 0 (i.e., return an all-0 image of minimal reasonable size) as a fallback.\n",
