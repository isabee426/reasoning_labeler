    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION: Input 3x3 → output 9x9 (scale factor 3 in each dimension).  \n2. PATTERN: For every input cell with color c≠0 place a 3×3 block equal to the entire original 3×3 input (preserving colors); input 0 cells map to all-0 3×3 blocks.  \n3. KEY CHANGES:  \nEX1: color 6 cells → input-pattern blocks; 0 → blank.  \nEX2: color 4 → input-pattern blocks; 0 → blank.  \nEX3: color 2 → input-pattern blocks; 0 → blank.  \nEX4: color 2 → input-pattern blocks; 0 → blank.  \nEX5: color 7 → input-pattern blocks; 0 → blank.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll inputs are 3x3. They differ only in which cells are nonzero and which color (6,4,2,7). The arrangement of nonzero vs zero cells changes between examples; colors stay constant per example.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll outputs are 9x9 (scale 3). Each 3x3 tile is either all zeros or equals the entire original 3x3 input pattern (colors preserved).\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nFor each input cell (i,j): if value c!=0, write the whole original 3x3 input (with its colors) into output block rows 3i..3i+2, cols 3j..3j+2; if c==0 fill that block with 0.\n\nReference objects: The 3x3 input itself (the pattern of nonzero cells = mask) is the invariant/template. Each input cell's color acts as a stamp color.\n\nGrid pattern: Output = 9x9 (3×3 tiling). For each input cell (r,c): if color=0 leave that 3×3 tile black; if color=c, place a 3×3 copy of the input's nonzero-mask but with filled cells set to c at output tile (r*3..r*3+2, c*3..c*3+2).\n\nObjects: The key recurring object is the whole input mask; outputs are repeated copies of that mask, colored by the source cell.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF the input grid is a 3x3 grid THEN create an output grid of size 9x9 and initialize every cell of the output grid to color 0.  \nStep 2: IF referring to an input cell at row r and column c (0-indexed) THEN define its corresponding 3x3 output tile as rows r*3..r*3+2 and columns c*3..c*3+2.  \nStep 3: IF an input cell (r,c) has color 0 THEN fill every cell of the corresponding 3x3 output tile with color 0.  \nStep 4: IF an input cell (r,c) has color d where d != 0 THEN for every position (i,j) in the original 3x3 input (i and j 0..2) perform the atomic actions in Steps 5 and 6 below for that (i,j).  \nStep 5: IF the original input cell at (i,j) is 0 AND we are stamping for input cell (r,c) with color d != 0 THEN set output cell at (r*3+i, c*3+j) to 0.  \nStep 6: IF the original input cell at (i,j) is not 0 AND we are stamping for input cell (r,c) with color d != 0 THEN set output cell at (r*3+i, c*3+j) to color d.\n",
