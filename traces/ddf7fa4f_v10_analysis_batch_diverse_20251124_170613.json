    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: 10x10 -> 10x10; connected regions of color 5 are recolored (no move/resize).\n\n2) PATTERN: There are three single-cell top markers; the three distinct color-5 connected regions are recolored to the top-marker colors in left-to-right order.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 5 -> {left:1, middle:4, right:7}\n- Ex2: 5 -> {left:2, middle:6, right:8}\n- Ex3: 5 -> {left:1, middle:6, right:7}\n\nStage1 (per example): puzzle=recolor; top markers cols and 5-region bboxes map left→right as above.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nSame: each input has three single-cell top markers (different colors), multiple connected regions of color 5, background 0. Diff: sizes/positions of the distinct 5-components vary.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nExactly same: top single-cell markers and background unchanged. Each original 5-region keeps its shape/location but is recolored to one of the top-marker colors (ex1: 1/4/7; ex2: 2/6/8; ex3: 1/6/7).\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nRule: for every connected color-5 component, recolor it to the color of the top-row single-cell whose column lies within that component’s horizontal span (vertical projection).\n\n1) REFERENCE: The three single-cell top markers stay fixed and keep their colors; they act as color keys and vertical zone dividers.\n\n2) GRID PATTERN: Every connected region of color 5 is recolored (no move/resize) to the color of the top marker whose column lies within that region’s horizontal span (i.e., region assigned to the top marker above it).\n\n3) OBJECTS: Critical objects = the distinct 5-regions and the three top markers; mapping is by horizontal position.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a cell is in row 0 AND its color is not 0 AND its color is not 5 AND that cell is a connected region of size 1 (single-cell) THEN mark that cell as a top marker and record its column index and its color number.  \nStep 2: IF exactly three top markers have been recorded THEN sort those three top markers by increasing column index and label them \"left marker\", \"middle marker\", and \"right marker\" (record each marker's color number).  \nStep 3: IF a set of orthogonally connected cells all have color 5 (i.e., a connected region whose color is 5) THEN identify that connected 5-region as an object and compute and record its horizontal bounding box min_col and max_col and its cell list.  \nStep 4: IF exactly three distinct 5-regions have been identified THEN sort those 5-regions by increasing bounding-box min_col and label them \"left-region\", \"middle-region\", and \"right-region\".  \nStep 5: IF an object is labeled \"left-region\" THEN change the color of every cell in that region to the color number of the \"left marker\".  \nStep 6: IF an object is labeled \"middle-region\" THEN change the color of every cell in that region to the color number of the \"middle marker\".  \nStep 7: IF an object is labeled \"right-region\" THEN change the color of every cell in that region to the color number of the \"right marker\".  \nStep 8: IF a cell is not part of any color-5 connected region THEN leave that cell's color unchanged.\n",
