    "raw_analysis": "1) Transformation: same-size 1:1 -- every pixel retained; connected regions of color 8 are recolored, no scaling or relocation.\n\n2) Pattern: classify each connected 8-region by its shape; identical-shaped regions get the same new nonzero color; holes and geometry preserved.\n\n3) Key changes:\nEx1: 8 -> {1,2,3}; Ex2: 8 -> {1,2,3}; Ex3: 8 -> {1,2,3,4}; Ex4: 8 -> {1,3}. In all examples 0 stays 0; only component colors change.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT ===\n- All inputs: several distinct connected regions of color 8 on a 0 background. Regions are hollow/frame-like shapes (rings, L-shapes, tall bars) of varying size/orientation. Some shape types repeat within a grid.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT ===\n- Background stays 0. Each entire connected 8-region is recolored to one uniform color (from {1,2,3,4}). Identical-shaped regions in the same image share the same new color.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT ===\n- Transformation: detect each connected 8-region, classify by shape/topology (hole count/arrangement and overall form), then recolor each region according to its shape class (different classes -> different colors; same class -> same color). This rule fits all examples.\n\n1) REFERENCE OBJECTS:\n- Every connected region of color 8 (hollow/frame-like shape) stays in place and keeps its geometry (outer frame + inner holes). These objects are the reference for recoloring.\n\n2) GRID PATTERN:\n- No scaling/translation. Same-size 1:1 output. Each distinct connected 8-region is recolored independently by a class rule based on its shape (bounding-box aspect) and number/arrangement of internal holes.\n\n3) OBJECTS:\n- Recurring types and color rules (consistent across examples):\n  - Compact square/frame with one central hole -> color1.\n  - Tall vertical frame with three stacked holes -> color2.\n  - L/complex frame with two separated holes -> color3.\n  - Long horizontal bar with three evenly spaced holes -> color4.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a maximal 4-connected region of pixels has color 8 THEN treat that maximal connected set of color-8 pixels as one object (do not modify any other pixels).\n\nStep 2: IF an object has been identified (a maximal color-8 connected region) THEN compute its bounding box [min_row,min_col,max_row,max_col] and extract the object's cropped pattern (the arrangement of 8 vs 0 inside that bounding box) and count its internal holes (connected 0-regions fully enclosed by the object in the cropped pattern).\n\nStep 3: IF two objects have identical bounding-box size AND their cropped patterns are identical (same pixels of object vs background within the bbox) THEN classify those two objects as the same shape class.\n\nStep 4: IF two objects are classified as the same shape class THEN they must receive the same single output color for all their object pixels (use one color for the class).\n\nStep 5: IF an object-class has not yet been assigned an output color THEN choose a unique color from the set {1,2,3,4} that is not yet used for any other shape class in this grid and assign that color to the class (reserve colors for distinct classes).\n\nStep 6: IF a pixel belongs to an object (its color in the input is 8) AND that object is assigned color C from step 5 THEN change that pixel's color to C in the output (do not change any 0 pixels, including holes).\n\nStep 7: IF a pixel's input color is 0 (either background or an internal hole of an object) THEN leave that pixel color as 0 in the output (preserve all 0 pixels exactly).\n",
