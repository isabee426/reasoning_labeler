    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Input and output are same size (9x9, 1:1). The task recolors vertical connected bars of color 5 without moving or resizing them.\n\n2) PATTERN (works for both): Identify each distinct vertical bar of 5, rank by height (tallest->shortest) and recolor them 1,2,3,4 respectively; background 0 unchanged.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Example 1: Bars heights = [8,5,4,2] (cols 7,3,5,1) -> 5->1,2,3,4; shapes/positions preserved.\n- Example 2: Bars heights = [9,8,6,3] (cols 5,1,3,7) -> 5->1,2,3,4; shapes/positions preserved.\n\nStage1: puzzle = bar-height ranking recolor; visual: four single-column vertical 5-regions; grid: replace 5 by rank-based color.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Same: both are 9x9, background 0, contain exactly four vertical connected objects all colored 5.  \n- Different: the columns occupied and the heights of those four bars vary.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: background 0, bar shapes/positions identical to inputs, bars recolored only using colors 1,2,3,4. The set of colors {1,2,3,4} appears once per bar.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: find each vertical connected object of color 5, measure height, sort by descending height and recolor them with 1,2,3,4 respectively (tallest->1, 2nd->2, 3rd->3, shortest->4). No movement or resizing; other pixels remain 0.\n\nReference objects: four vertical connected bars (color 5) remain identical in shape and position; they guide the transform by their heights.\n\nGrid pattern: recolor each bar according to its height rank among the four: tallest->1, 2nd->2, 3rd->3, shortest->4. Background and geometry stay unchanged.\n\nObjects: the four connected vertical bars are the only relevant objects; measure their connected-cell heights to assign colors.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a cell's color is 5 AND it is orthogonally connected (4-neighbor) to other color-5 cells forming a contiguous region, THEN mark that contiguous region as a distinct object (a vertical bar object).\n\n2. Step 2: IF an object is a distinct contiguous region composed only of color 5 AND all its cells have the same column index (i.e., the region is a vertical bar), THEN compute and record its height as the number of cells in that object and record its minimum column index.\n\n3. Step 3: IF exactly four distinct vertical-bar objects (color 5) have been identified and measured, THEN proceed to rank those four objects by height; otherwise perform no recoloring.\n\n4. Step 4: IF ranking the four objects by height, THEN order them from tallest to shortest by their recorded heights.\n\n5. Step 5: IF any two objects have equal height during ranking, THEN break the tie by preferring the object with the smaller (leftmost) minimum column index as the taller (higher-ranked) object.\n\n6. Step 6: IF an object is the tallest in the ordered list (rank 1), THEN change the color of every cell in that object from 5 to 1.\n\n7. Step 7: IF an object is the second-tallest in the ordered list (rank 2), THEN change the color of every cell in that object from 5 to 2.\n\n8. Step 8: IF an object is the third-tallest in the ordered list (rank 3), THEN change the color of every cell in that object from 5 to 3.\n\n9. Step 9: IF an object is the shortest in the ordered list (rank 4), THEN change the color of every cell in that object from 5 to 4.\n\n10. Step 10: IF a cell's color is not 5 (for example color 0 background), THEN leave that cell's color unchanged.\n",
