    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Uniform upscale by factor 3 (3x3 -> 9x9), same ratio in all examples.\n\n2) PATTERN: Each input cell becomes a 3x3 tile; a 0 cell -> 3x3 zeros. A nonzero cell with color c -> tile filled with c except positions that match the input's nonzero pixel locations are set to 0 (tile = complement of input's mask, colored by that cell).\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\nEx1: input 6 at (0,2),(1,1),(2,0); each 6 -> 3x3 tile with 6 everywhere except those three positions zero; zeros -> zero tiles.\nEx2: input 7 at (0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1); each 7 -> 3x3 tile with 7 in corners, zeros at cross positions.\nEx3: input 4 at (0,0),(0,1),(1,2),(2,2); each 4 -> 3x3 tile with zeros at those four coords, 4 elsewhere.\n\nStage1 summary per example: puzzle type = upscaling + mask-inversion; visual = output is a 3x3 grid of tiles; grid analysis = each tile encodes complement of original colored-pixel pattern, colored by the source cell.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll inputs are 3x3. They differ in which cells are nonzero and in the nonzero color (6,7,4). Same: discrete cells, same size, nonzero pixels form small shapes.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll outputs are 9x9 (3x upscale). Zeros always expand to a 3x3 all-zero block. Nonzero input pixels expand to a 3x3 block placed at the corresponding 3x3 slot. Each color uses a consistent 3x3 motif (6,7,4 each have their own motif).\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nRule: upscale by 3. For input cell at (i,j) place a 3x3 tile at (3i..3i+2,3j..3j+2): 0 -> all zeros; color c -> the fixed 3x3 motif associated with c.\n\n1) Reference objects: Single nonzero input cells are the anchors. Their color and 3x3 input coordinates stay the same and determine placement in output.\n\n2) Grid pattern: Uniform 3x upscale into a 3x3 macro-grid. For every input nonzero, place a 3x3 tile in the corresponding 3x3 output block. Background stays black.\n\n3) Objects: The most important objects are colored pixels; each color has a fixed 3x3 motif (tile) that is reused for every occurrence and placed according to the input cell positions.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input grid is a 3x3 block THEN create an output grid of size 9x9 and initialize every output pixel to color 0.  \n2. Step 2: IF an input cell is at coordinates (r,c) with color 0 THEN set every pixel in the corresponding 3x3 output block with rows 3*r..3*r+2 and columns 3*c..3*c+2 to color 0.  \n3. Step 3: IF an input cell is at coordinates (r,c) with a nonzero color X (X ? {1..9}) THEN fill the corresponding 3x3 output block (rows 3*r..3*r+2, cols 3*c..3*c+2) entirely with color X.  \n4. Step 4: IF an input cell at coordinates (i,j) (where i and j range 0..2) is nonzero (its color is not 0) THEN for every input-cell-derived 3x3 output block (the block for any input coordinate (r,c)), set the pixel at absolute output coordinate (3*r + i, 3*c + j) to color 0.  \n5. Step 5: IF an input cell at (r,c) is nonzero with color X THEN after applying Step 3 and Step 4 the resulting 3x3 block at rows 3*r..3*r+2 and cols 3*c..3*c+2 will show color X at all positions except those positions (3*r+i,3*c+j) for which the original input at (i,j) was nonzero; those positions remain 0.\n",
