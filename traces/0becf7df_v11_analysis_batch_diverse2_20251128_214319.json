    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Grid size unchanged (10x10); colors are permuted (1:1 mapping), no scaling.\n\n2) PATTERN: The 2x2 color legend at top-left [[a,b],[c,d]] is transformed by swapping its columns (a<->b and c<->d) and that color swap is applied to all nonzero pixels; shapes and positions stay the same.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 1->3, 3->1, 2->8, 8->2; shapes and 0 background unchanged.\n- Ex2: 4->2, 2->4, 3->7, 7->3; shapes and 0 unchanged.\n- Ex3: 9->4, 4->9, 7->6, 6->7; shapes and 0 unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs 10x10. Each has a 2x2 color legend at (0,0)-(1,1): [[a,b],[c,d]] and one four-armed connected shape elsewhere built from those four colors. Arm locations/orientations vary.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All outputs keep the 2x2 legend identical to the input. The shape geometry/position is unchanged; only the four colors are permuted.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: swap colors between the two legend columns for the shape (left-top?right-top, left-bottom?right-bottom). Examples: 1?3,2?8; 4?2,3?7; 9?4,7?6. Legend pixels are not recolored.\n\nReference objects: the 2x2 legend at (0,0)-(1,1) is preserved and defines the color mapping.\n\nGrid pattern: apply a fixed color permutation everywhere else: swap the two top-row legend colors (a <-> b) and swap the two bottom-row legend colors (c <-> d). Grid size and positions unchanged.\n\nObjects: only the large four-armed connected shape is recolored by those swaps; background and legend remain intact.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a non-legend cell has the same color as the cell at row 0 column 0 (top-left) THEN change that non-legend cell's color to the color of the cell at row 0 column 1 (top-right).\n\n2. Step 2: IF a non-legend cell has the same color as the cell at row 0 column 1 (top-right) THEN change that non-legend cell's color to the color of the cell at row 0 column 0 (top-left).\n\n3. Step 3: IF a non-legend cell has the same color as the cell at row 1 column 0 (bottom-left of the 2x2 legend) THEN change that non-legend cell's color to the color of the cell at row 1 column 1 (bottom-right of the 2x2 legend).\n\n4. Step 4: IF a non-legend cell has the same color as the cell at row 1 column 1 (bottom-right of the 2x2 legend) THEN change that non-legend cell's color to the color of the cell at row 1 column 0 (bottom-left of the 2x2 legend).\n\n5. Step 5: IF a cell is located at one of the four legend positions (row 0 col 0, row 0 col 1, row 1 col 0, row 1 col 1) THEN do not change that cell's color.\n\n6. Step 6: IF a cell's color is 0 (background) THEN leave that cell unchanged.\n",
