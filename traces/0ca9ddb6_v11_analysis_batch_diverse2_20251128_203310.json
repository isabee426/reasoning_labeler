    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Input and output are same size (9x9), ratio 1:1.\n\n2. PATTERN: Consistent rule: each cell of color 1 is decorated by placing color 7 on its four orthogonal neighbors; each cell of color 2 is decorated by placing color 4 on its four diagonal neighbors. Other colored single pixels remain and positions unchanged.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 1 at (3,2) & (6,6) gain orthogonal 7s; 2 at (2,6)&(7,1) gain diagonal 4s; 8 at (0,3) unchanged.\n- Ex2: 1 at (6,6) gains orthogonal 7s; 2 at (3,2) gains diagonal 4s.\n- Ex3: 1 at (7,3) gains orthogonal 7s; 2 at (2,2) gains diagonal 4s; 6 at (5,6) unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nInputs differ only by positions of colored single pixels (1 and 2 and some other colors like 6,8). All share a 9x9 black background and sparse isolated colored cells.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll outputs keep original non-1/2 cells in place. Every 1 gains 7s at its four orthogonal neighbors; every 2 gains 4s at its four diagonal neighbors. Grid size unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nRule for all: preserve originals; for each cell=1 add 7 at N,S,E,W; for each cell=2 add 4 at NW,NE,SW,SE.\n\n- Reference: grid size and all single-pixel reference objects stay in place; these singles (colors 1 and 2) guide the edits.  \n- Grid pattern: universally, add decorations around those singles: for color 1 add cardinal neighbors (N,S,E,W) colored 7; for color 2 add the four diagonal neighbors (NW,NE,SW,SE) colored 4.  \n- Objects: the important recurring objects are the isolated single pixels of color 1 and 2; other colors remain unchanged.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a cell's color in the input is not 0 (i.e., color is 1,2,6,8, etc.) THEN keep that same cell the same color in the output (do not change or overwrite original nonzero pixels).  \nStep 2: IF a cell's color in the input is 1 THEN set each of its four orthogonal neighbor cells (north, south, east, west) to color 7 in the output, but only for neighbor positions that are within the grid bounds AND whose color in the input is 0.  \nStep 3: IF a cell's color in the input is 2 THEN set each of its four diagonal neighbor cells (northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast) to color 4 in the output, but only for neighbor positions that are within the grid bounds AND whose color in the input is 0.  \nStep 4: IF a decoration (color 7 or color 4) would be placed on a cell that in the input is nonzero (color != 0) THEN do not overwrite that cell (preserve the original color instead).  \nStep 5: IF more than one decoration rule targets the same input-zero cell (i.e., both a 7 and a 4 would be placed on that same cell) THEN resolve the conflict by placing color 7 (priority to the decoration produced by color 1) in the output.  \nStep 6: IF a cell in the input is 0 and no decoration rule applies to it (no neighboring color-1 or color-2 causes placement) THEN leave that cell 0 in the output.\n",
