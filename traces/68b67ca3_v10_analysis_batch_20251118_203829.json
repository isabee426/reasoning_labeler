Empty (0) elsewhere.\n- Differences: which even positions are colored and the color values (1,2,3,6,8, etc) vary.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: every output is 3x3 and contains the values from input positions (r,c) in {0,2,4}×{0,2,4}.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: downscale by 2 via sampling: out[i,j] = in[2*i,2*j] (colors copied exactly).\n\nReference objects: single-cell colored patches at even row/col indices (rows 0,2,4; cols 0,2,4). They keep their color and determine output.\n\nGrid pattern: universal downscale 6x6 → 3x3 by factor 2: output[r,c] = input[2r,2c] (sample top-left of each 2×2 block).\n\nObjects: the recurring important objects are those isolated colored cells on even coordinates; background zeros are ignored. This rule fits all examples.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nGeneral rule (works for all training examples): The input is a 6x6 grid and the output is a 3x3 grid formed by sampling every second row and every second column of the input (i.e. take the cells at coordinates (0,2,4) in both row and column). Concretely, for all i,j in {0,1,2} the output cell out[i,j] = in[2*i, 2*j]. Colors are copied exactly (use the same integer color values); if the sampled input cell is 0 the output cell is 0. No rotation, reflection, or recoloring is performed — the spatial arrangement and color values of the sampled cells are preserved. Effectively this is a downscale-by-2 nearest-neighbor sampling that picks the top-left cell of each 2x2 block. Any nonzero objects in the input must lie on even row and column indices (0,2,4) and these determine the nonzero cells in the 3x3 output. This rule is general and will apply to any similar 6x6 → 3x3 task following the same placement pattern.\n",
