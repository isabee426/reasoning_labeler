All nonzero objects are translated one cell to the right.\n\n2) PATTERN: Consistent rule: every distinct connected colored region is shifted horizontally +1 column; shape, color, and rows remain the same.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: all 8s move one column right; 0 background unchanged.\n- Ex2: all 6s and all 2s move one column right; shapes/colors preserved.\n\nStage 1: puzzle = object translation (right shift).\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Differences: objects appear at different row/col locations; colors differ (8 in ex1; 6 and 2 in ex2); number of objects differs.\n- Same: each input contains distinct connected colored regions with the same shape/outline and orientation.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: every output preserves each region's color (8/6/2), shape and connectivity; background 0 unchanged; every region is shifted exactly +1 column (one cell right).\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule that fits ALL: each nonzero connected region is translated one cell to the right, color and shape preserved.\n\nReference objects: Each nonzero connected region (shape, orientation, color, internal hole) is preserved and thus serves as the anchor — shape and color never change.\n\nGrid pattern: Entire nonzero content is shifted one cell to the right (1:1 grid, no rotation/flip, connectivity preserved).\n\nObjects: Recurring hollow C/rectangular-ring shapes; every distinct filled region is treated the same and translated right by one cell.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a cell is part of a connected region whose color is not 0 (treat connectivity as 4-neighbor adjacency) THEN consider the entire connected region of that same nonzero color as one object.  \nStep 2: IF a region is identified as an object (color is not 0) THEN compute the object's target positions by adding +1 to the column index of every cell in that object (move every object cell one unit right).  \nStep 3: IF every computed target position for an object lies inside the grid bounds (target column ≤ maximum column index) THEN write the object's original color into each target cell and set each original cell of that object to 0 (clear the original positions).  \nStep 4: IF two or more objects have target positions that coincide when moved by +1 column THEN perform all objects' translations simultaneously and place each object's color into its computed target cells (apply all moves at once so each object's shape and color are preserved).  \nStep 5: IF an object contains internal 0 cells (holes) or preserves its connectivity/shape THEN keep those internal 0 cells at the same relative positions inside the moved object (holes move with the object).  \nStep 6: IF a cell is color 0 and is not a target of any moved object THEN leave that cell as 0 (background remains unchanged).\n",
