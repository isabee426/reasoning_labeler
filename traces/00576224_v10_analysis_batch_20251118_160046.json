For tile-rows with even index (the top and bottom tile-rows) copy the 2×2 input exactly into every 2×2 tile in that row. For tile-rows with odd index (the middle tile-row) fill every 2×2 tile with the input horizontally flipped (swap left and right columns so positions [0,0]↔[0,1] and [1,0]↔[1,1]).
