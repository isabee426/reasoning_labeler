    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: grid size unchanged (10x10 → 10x10), ratio 1:1.\n\n2) PATTERN: All distinct colored connected components are translated to the top-left corner, kept in the same left→right input order and packed along a NW→SE diagonal (staircase); shapes and orientations are preserved.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: colors 8,7,2 moved from bottom row to top-left; shapes unchanged, arranged 8 then 7 then 2 diagonally.\n- Ex2: colors 1,2,3,4 (left→right) moved to top-left in that order, shapes unchanged, packed diagonally.\n- Ex3: colors 4,2,3 moved left→right to top-left, shapes unchanged, placed in diagonal packing.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs contain multiple distinct connected colored blocks located along the bottom rows, laid out left→right. Colors: ex1 {8,7,2}, ex2 {1,2,3,4}, ex3 {4,2,3}. They differ in object shapes, widths and exact bottom positions.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly the same: each output preserves every object's color and shape, moves all objects into the top-left, arranges them in the original left→right order in a descending diagonal (staircase), and leaves the rest of the grid 0.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: translate each connected component (no rotation/recolor) to top-left, preserving left→right input order by placing them as a non-overlapping diagonal stack (each next object shifted down/right).\n\n- Reference objects: The distinct colored connected components along the bottom row act as anchors; their left-to-right order is preserved and dictates target ordering.\n\n- Grid pattern: Each component is translated to the top-left region in sequence, forming a down-right \"staircase\": first object anchored at (0,0), each next shifted +1 row and +1 col relative to the previous. Grid size unchanged.\n\n- Objects: The recurring objects are the colored connected blocks (their shapes/sizes preserved).\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a set of one or more 4-connected cells all share the same color C and C != 0 THEN treat that set as a distinct object and compute its bounding box [min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col].\n\n2. Step 2: IF there are two or more distinct objects as defined in Step 1 THEN order the objects by ascending bounding-box min_col (left-to-right); if two objects share the same min_col, break ties by ascending min_row.\n\n3. Step 3: IF an object is the k-th object in the left-to-right order with index k starting at 0 for the leftmost object THEN compute its target placement so that the object's bounding-box top-left cell is moved to (row = k, col = k).\n\n4. Step 4: IF placing the object as in Step 3 THEN move every cell of that object by the same translation (delta_row = k - min_row, delta_col = k - min_col) without rotating or reflecting the object, preserving every cell's color C and the object's internal offsets.\n\n5. Step 5: IF an object's original cells are moved to their target positions as in Step 4 THEN set all original cells of that object (their previous coordinates) to color 0 (erase the original footprint).\n\n6. Step 6: IF any moved cell would fall outside the 10x10 grid bounds THEN discard (clip) those cells so that only cells with 0 <= row <= 9 and 0 <= col <= 9 are painted (no wrapping).\n\n7. Step 7: IF all objects are placed following Steps 2–6 in order k=0,1,2,... THEN the result is a NW→SE (down-right) staircase: the first object's bounding-box top-left is at (0,0), the second at (1,1), the third at (2,2), etc., preserving each object's shape and color.\n",
