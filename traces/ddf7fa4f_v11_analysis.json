    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Output size equals input size (10x10); no scaling or translation, only recoloring of regions.  \n2. PATTERN: Every distinct connected region of color 5 is recolored to the color of the single-pixel \"chip\" in the top row whose column overlaps that region.  \n3. KEY CHANGES:  \n- Ex1: 5-regions → 1 (left), 7 (right), 4 (bottom); other colors unchanged.  \n- Ex2: 5-regions → 2 (left), 6 (center), 8 (right); other colors unchanged.  \n- Ex3: 5-regions → 1 (left), 7 (right), 6 (bottom/center); other colors unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Same: every input has three distinct connected regions of color 5 and three single-pixel colored markers on row 0; background 0 and other colored pixels present.\n- Different: shapes/positions of the 5-regions and which top-row colors (e.g. 1,4,7 or 2,6,8) align with them.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly the same: all pixels not equal to 5 remain unchanged; row-0 singletons unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: for each connected color-5 object, recolor every cell to the color of the row-0 colored cell whose column lies inside that object's horizontal span (bbox).\n\nReference objects: three single-pixel colored markers in row 0 stay fixed and serve as color references. Grid pattern: output keeps size/shape/positions; each distinct orange region is recolored to the marker color whose column is horizontally nearest (match by x-coordinate/order). Objects: the three connected orange blobs (color 5) are the critical recurring objects; they get mapped left→middle→right to the top markers.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a pixel is in row 0 AND its color is not 0 THEN record that pixel as a color marker (store its column index and its color) AND do not change that pixel's color in the output.  \n2. Step 2: IF a set of pixels forms a connected region AND every pixel in that region has color 5 THEN mark that connected region as a target region and compute the set of column indices occupied by that region (the region's horizontal span and horizontal centroid).  \n3. Step 3: IF a target region (color 5) contains at least one pixel whose column index equals the column index of a recorded row-0 marker THEN change the color of every pixel in that target region to the color of that recorded row-0 marker.  \n4. Step 4: IF a target region contains column indices that match more than one recorded row-0 marker column (ambiguous case) THEN change the color of every pixel in the target region to the color of the recorded marker whose column index has the smallest absolute difference to the region's horizontal centroid.  \n5. Step 5: IF a pixel's color is not 5 AND the pixel is not a recorded row-0 marker from Step 1 THEN leave that pixel's color unchanged in the output.  \n6. Step 6: IF any pixel exists in the input grid THEN do not move or resize any pixels or regions (preserve all positions and shapes); perform only the recoloring actions specified above.\n",
