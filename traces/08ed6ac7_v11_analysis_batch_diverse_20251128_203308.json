    "raw_analysis": "Transformation type: 1:1 grid (9x9->9x9); objects recolored, size/positions preserved.\n\nPattern (works for both): locate four vertical connected orange (5) bars, rank by height (descending) and assign colors 1..4 so tallest->1, 2nd->2, 3rd->3, shortest->4; background 0 unchanged.\n\nEx1: bars at cols 1,3,5,7 heights 2,5,4,8 -> colors 4,2,3,1; shapes unchanged.\nEx2: bars at cols 1,3,5,7 heights 8,6,9,3 -> colors 2,3,1,4; shapes unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nBoth inputs contain four vertical connected bars of color 5 in four columns. Heights differ between examples (different rank order), but bar shapes, connectivity and column positions are preserved.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll outputs preserve bar shape/positions and background. Each 5-bar is recolored to one of {1,2,3,4}. The mapping is identical across examples.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nFor each connected vertical object of color 5, rank bars by height (descending) and recolor: tallest->1, 2nd->2, 3rd->3, shortest->4; sizes/locations unchanged.\n\n1) Reference objects: the four vertical connected bars of color 5 remain at the same columns and with identical heights; they anchor the mapping.\n\n2) Grid pattern: 1:1 recolor of each distinct vertical bar by height rank: tallest->color1, 2nd->color2, 3rd->color3, shortest->color4.\n\n3) Objects: the four vertical bars are the key recurring objects (connected components); transformation sorts them by height and assigns colors accordingly.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a group of 4-neighbor connected cells all have color is 5 AND all cells of that group share the same column index (i.e., are vertically aligned) THEN identify that group as a vertical bar object and record its column and its size (count of cells).\n\n2. Step 2: IF exactly four vertical bar objects have been identified by Step 1 THEN continue to the ranking steps; ELSE do not apply any recoloring actions.\n\n3. Step 3: IF a region is an identified vertical bar object THEN compute and store its height as the number of cells in that object.\n\n4. Step 4: IF there are recorded vertical bar objects with stored heights THEN sort these objects by stored height in descending order and assign each object a rank attribute where rank = 1 for the tallest, rank = 2 for second tallest, rank = 3 for third tallest, and rank = 4 for shortest; IF two objects have equal height THEN break ties by smaller column index (leftmost gets the higher rank).\n\n5. Step 5: IF an object has rank = 1 THEN change the color of every cell in that object to color 1.\n\n6. Step 6: IF an object has rank = 2 THEN change the color of every cell in that object to color 2.\n\n7. Step 7: IF an object has rank = 3 THEN change the color of every cell in that object to color 3.\n\n8. Step 8: IF an object has rank = 4 THEN change the color of every cell in that object to color 4.\n\n9. Step 9: IF a cell's color is not 5 (for example color is 0 or any color != 5) THEN leave that cell's color and position unchanged.\n",
