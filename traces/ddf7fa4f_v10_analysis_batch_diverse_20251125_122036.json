Each output preserves original top-row single pixels.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: For every connected region of color 5, recolor that entire region to the color of the single nonzero pixel in the top row whose column lies within that region's horizontal span (use that top-row color number: 1/4/7, 2/6/8, 1/6/7).\n\nReference objects: The single non‑zero pixels in the top row remain unchanged and act as color keys. Background and overall 10x10 layout stay the same.\n\nGrid pattern: For every distinct connected region of color 5, recolor all its cells to the color of the top-row pixel whose horizontal span overlaps that region (the top key above it).\n\nObjects: The critical, recurring objects are the separate connected 5‑regions; their bounding columns determine which top color is assigned.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a pixel is in row 0 AND its color is not 0 THEN leave that pixel's color unchanged.\n\nStep 2: IF a pixel's color is not 5 (and it is not in a connected region of color 5) THEN leave that pixel's color unchanged.\n\nStep 3: IF there exists a connected region (orthogonally connected) of pixels whose color is 5 THEN compute that region's horizontal span as min_col and max_col (the minimum and maximum column indices of pixels in that connected region).\n\nStep 4: IF a connected region of color 5 has min_col <= c <= max_col for exactly one pixel at (row 0, column c) whose color is X and X != 0 THEN change the color of every pixel in that connected region of color 5 to color X.\n\nStep 5: IF a connected region of color 5 has no pixel in row 0 with column between min_col and max_col whose color is non-zero THEN leave the region's pixels unchanged.\n\nStep 6: IF a connected region of color 5 has more than one non-zero pixel in row 0 with columns between min_col and max_col (colors X1, X2, ...) THEN pick the top-row pixel whose column is closest to the region's horizontal center (floor((min_col+max_col)/2) to break ties) and change every pixel in that connected region of color 5 to that chosen top-row pixel's color.\n\nStep 7: IF any pixels were changed by the above steps THEN do not change any other pixels; preserve all original pixels that are not part of a recolored connected region of color 5.\n",
