    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: 10x10 → 10x10; no shape/size change — connected orange regions (color 5) are recolored.\n\n2) PATTERN: In all examples each distinct connected region of color 5 is replaced by the color of a single colored pixel on the top row, matched by horizontal (left→center→right) ordering; background and top pixels remain.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\nEx1: left 5→1, right 5→7, bottom 5→4.\nEx2: left 5→2, center 5→6, right 5→8.\nEx3: left 5→1, center 5→6, right 5→7.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Same: each input has several distinct connected regions of color 5; a few nonzero colored single pixels in row0.\n- Different: number, horizontal span and positions of the 5-regions and the specific colors/cols in row0 vary.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: non-5 pixels unchanged; each 5-region keeps shape/position but is recolored. Every output recolors each 5-region to a single color.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule that fits all: for each connected region of color 5, recolor every cell in that region to the nonzero color present in row 0 within the region's column span (use that top-row color).\n\nReference objects: the nonzero single pixels in row 0 are fixed and act as color keys.\n\nGrid pattern: for every distinct connected orange region (color 5), fill that region with the color of the nonzero pixel in row 0 whose column lies above/within the region's horizontal span. No shape/size or position changes otherwise.\n\nObjects: the connected color-5 blobs are primary; row‑0 singletons are the mapping labels.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a pixel is in row 0 AND its color is not 0 THEN mark that pixel as a \"row-0 color-key\" with its column index and its color value (use the pixel's color number as the key color).\n\nStep 2: IF a group of pixels forms a connected region of color 5 (connectivity = 4-connected) THEN compute that region's horizontal span as min_col and max_col (the minimum and maximum column indices of pixels in the region).\n\nStep 3: IF a connected region of color 5 has at least one row-0 color-key whose column c satisfies min_col <= c <= max_col THEN select among those keys the single key whose column is nearest to the region's horizontal center (center = floor((min_col+max_col)/2)); IF there is a tie choose the leftmost such key.\n\nStep 4: IF a key was selected for a color-5 region (per Step 3) THEN change the color of every pixel in that connected region of color 5 to the selected key's color value (use the exact color number of the row-0 key).\n\nStep 5: IF a connected region of color 5 has no row-0 color-key with column inside its horizontal span (no key with min_col <= c <= max_col) THEN leave that region's pixels unchanged (keep color 5).\n\nStep 6: IF a pixel's color is not 5 THEN do not change that pixel's color (preserve all non-5 pixels, including row-0 keys and the background).\n\nStep 7: IF multiple connected regions of color 5 exist then apply Steps 2–6 independently to each region (each region is recolored only according to the row-0 key selected for that region).\n",
