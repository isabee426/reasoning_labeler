PATTERN: Every distinct connected region of color 5 is recolored to the color of the single nonzero pixel in row0 whose column lies inside that region's horizontal span; all other pixels unchanged.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: three 5-regions → left:5→1, right:5→7, bottom:5→4; row0 pixels (1,4,7) stay.\n- Ex2: three 5-regions → left:5→2, center:5→6, bottom-right:5→8; row0 pixels (2,6,8) stay.\n- Ex3: three 5-regions → left:5→1, center/lower:5→6, right-top cluster:5→7; row0 pixels (1,6,7) stay.\n\nStage1 summary: puzzle = recolor connected 5-objects using top-row color aligned by column; grid geometry unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Same: 10x10, several distinct connected regions of color 5 and three single-cell colored pixels in row 0.\n- Different: shapes/positions of the 5-regions and which colors appear in row0 (ex1: 1,4,7; ex2: 2,6,8; ex3: 1,6,7).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: all non-5 cells remain unchanged; every 5-region is uniformly recolored to one of the row0 single-cell colors; grid layout preserved.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule that fits all: For each connected region of color 5, recolor it to the color of the single-cell in row0 whose column falls inside that region’s horizontal span (i.e. 5 -> that top-row color).\n\nReference objects: the small single‑pixel colored markers in row 0 remain fixed and serve as color keys.\n\nGrid pattern: every distinct connected orange (color 5) region is preserved in shape/position but recolored to the top‑row marker color whose column overlaps or is horizontally nearest to that region (use region's column span/centroid).\n\nObjects: the recurring, critical objects are the separate orange blocks; their horizontal location determines which top marker color they take.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the grid is 10x10 THEN proceed with the following object-based operations (do not change grid size).  \n2. Step 2: IF a cell is in row 0 AND its color is nonzero (color is not 0) THEN leave that cell's color unchanged (keep color as is).  \n3. Step 3: IF a cell's color is not 5 AND it is not in row 0 THEN leave that cell's color unchanged (keep color as is).  \n4. Step 4: IF there exists a distinct connected region whose color is 5 (a connected region of pixels where color is 5) THEN compute that region's horizontal span [min_col, max_col] (the minimum and maximum column indices occupied by the region).  \n5. Step 5: IF a distinct connected region color is 5 AND there is at least one nonzero pixel in row 0 with column c such that min_col <= c <= max_col THEN change the color of every pixel in that 5-region to the color of the pixel at (row 0, column c).  \n6. Step 6: IF a distinct connected region color is 5 AND more than one nonzero pixel in row 0 lies inside [min_col, max_col] THEN choose the nonzero pixel with the smallest column index (leftmost) and change the color of every pixel in that 5-region to that chosen row-0 pixel's color (change color to that color).  \n7. Step 7: IF a distinct connected region color is 5 AND no nonzero pixel in row 0 lies inside [min_col, max_col] THEN choose the nonzero pixel in row 0 with minimal horizontal distance to the region's span (if tied choose the leftmost) and change the color of every pixel in that 5-region to that chosen row-0 pixel's color (change color to that color).\n",
