    "raw_analysis": "1) Transformation type: size preserved (7x7 → 7x7), ratio 1:1.\n\n2) Pattern (consistent): take the three colored cells on the input diagonal and expand them into a full 3-color cyclic tiling: each row is the 3-color sequence shifted cyclically.\n\n3) Key changes:\n- Ex1: {1,2,4} → tiled repeating [2,4,1] rows shifted; zeros removed.\n- Ex2: {2,8,3} → tiled repeating [2,8,3] rows shifted.\n- Ex3: {4,8,3} → tiled repeating [4,8,3] rows shifted.\n\nStage1 per example (brief):\n- Ex1: puzzle type: pattern extension/tiling. Visual: small diagonal of 1,2,4 at corner. Grid: output = 3-color cyclic tile (rows shifted).\n- Ex2: type: tiling. Visual: 2,8,3 diagonal. Grid: output = cyclic 2,8,3 tile.\n- Ex3: type: tiling. Visual: diagonal of 8,3,4 and separate yellow but ignored. Grid: output = cyclic 4,8,3 tile.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Same: all are 7x7 with three distinct nonzero colors and background 0.\n- Different: location/orientation of the three colored cells (corner/stepped diagonal vary).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- EXACT same: every output is a full 7x7 3-color cyclic tiling with period 3: rows are cyclic shifts and columns follow the same 3-cycle.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: take the three distinct nonzero colors in the input (e.g. ex1 {1,2,4}; ex2 {2,8,3}; ex3 {4,8,3}), keep their cyclic order as seen along the input diagonal, and tile the whole 7x7 grid with that 3-color cycle (rows shift by one).\n\n1) Reference objects: the three nonzero diagonal cells (their colors and order) are preserved as the seed for transformation.\n\n2) Grid pattern: tile that 3-color sequence across the full 7×7 as a 2D periodic pattern (period 3 along rows/cols), creating a diagonal/checker lattice.\n\n3) Objects: the three single-cell colored regions are the critical objects; background zeros are ignored.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input grid is 7x7 THEN proceed to analyze colors (no change to cells).\n2. Step 2: IF the grid contains exactly three distinct nonzero colors (call them a, b, c) THEN record the set {a,b,c} (no change to cells).\n3. Step 3: IF there exists a row, column, main diagonal (increasing row and increasing column), or anti-diagonal (increasing row and decreasing column) that contains three nonzero cells of three different colors THEN set the initial ordered triple [x,y,z] to the colors encountered in that line in the natural reading direction (row: left-to-right; column: top-to-bottom; main diagonal: top-left to bottom-right; anti-diagonal: top-right to bottom-left).\n4. Step 4: IF no single row/column/diagonal contains three different nonzero colors THEN find any three distinct nonzero cells that are connected along the stepped diagonal direction used by the colored pattern (connected by king moves along the same slope) and order them by increasing row then increasing column to form an initial ordered triple [x,y,z].\n5. Step 5: IF an ordered triple [x,y,z] is available THEN create a 3-color cyclic pattern P where P[0]=x, P[1]=y, P[2]=z and assign every output cell at coordinates (r,c) the color P[(r + c) mod 3] (i.e., tile the 7x7 grid so each row is a cyclic shift of the triple).\n6. Step 6: IF any nonzero input cell at position (r,c) does not match the color assigned by P[(r + c) mod 3] THEN cyclically rotate the triple [x,y,z] to [y,z,x] (one left rotation) and reassign colors using Step 5; repeat up to two more rotations until all nonzero input cells match their original colors.\n7. Step 7: IF after three cyclic rotations no pattern makes all input nonzero cells match then (fallback) set the output to a 7x7 tiling with the three colors in any fixed cyclic order (for example [min(a,b,c), next, next]) using the rule in Step 5.\n",
