    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Input and output dimensions are identical in every example (ratio 1:1).\n\n2) PATTERN: The grid is split by the purple row (color 9). Non-background colored single pixels above the divider (color 5) are repositioned into a neat upper diagonal (preserving row order); colored pixels below (colors 2/6) are normalized to color 2 and repositioned into a lower diagonal. Purple (9) and background (7) stay.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 5s above row4 moved to upper-right diagonal; 2/6 below become 2s placed along a lower diagonal; 9-row and 7s unchanged.\n- Ex2: 5s above moved to same top band/row forming adjacent 5s; 6s below become 2s at corresponding lower positions; 9 and 7 unchanged.\n- Ex3: same: 5s above rearranged into an upper diagonal; 2/6 below normalized to 2 and placed in a lower diagonal; 9 and 7 unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All examples same dims. A purple row (9) splits the grid. Background =7 everywhere else. Above purple there are isolated orange pixels (5). Below purple there are small clusters of colors 2 and 6.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Purple row (9) unchanged. Background 7 unchanged. All top-side colored pixels are 5; all bottom-side colored pixels are 2. For every column with a 5 above, there's a matching 2 below mirrored across the purple row.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: convert any below-purple 6→2. Then for each column that has a colored pixel in the input, place a 5 in the top segment and a 2 in the symmetric row below the purple row (mirror vertically).\n\nReference objects: the purple divider row (9) and background (7) never change — they anchor the transform. Colored pixels above the divider (orange, 5) and below (reds/magentas, 2/6) are the only moved objects.\n\nGrid pattern (works for all): keep dims; collect each half's colored pixels and re-place them as a compact slanted line adjacent to the divider — top group arranged in a down‑right diagonal, bottom group in a down‑left diagonal, preserving each group's ordering. \n\nObjects: key are the orange singletons above and the red/magenta tokens below; transformation redistributes them into the two diagonal alignments while divider/background remain fixed.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1) The overall grid size and every cell of color 9 (the continuous purple divider row) and color 7 (background) remain unchanged. 2) Consider only the non-background pixels above the divider that are color 5; collect them in order from top-to-bottom (and left-to-right when tied on the same row). 3) Re-place those color-5 pixels in the top half so they form a single compact down-right slanted line (a down-right diagonal), filling the diagonal positions starting nearest the divider and preserving the original top-to-bottom ordering of the 5s (and preserving left-to-right ordering for any that shared a row). 4) For every placed 5 above the divider, place a matching pixel of color 2 in the cell that is the vertical mirror across the purple row (same column, row reflected across the divider). 5) All original colored pixels below the divider (colors 2 and 6) are discarded and replaced only by these mirrored color-2 pixels; any original color-6 pixels are treated as equivalent to color 2 (the below-divider color is normalized to 2 in the output). 6) No other colors are introduced or changed: only the top region’s color-5 pixels are rearranged into the diagonal, the divider (9) and background (7) stay the same, and the bottom region contains exactly the mirrored set of color-2 pixels corresponding to the arranged color-5 pixels above.\n",
