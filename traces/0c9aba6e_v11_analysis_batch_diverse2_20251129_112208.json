TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Each output is the 6x4 block taken from the input rows above the full row of 7s (13x4 -> top 6x4); size ratio consistent (13->6 by chopping at the 7-row).  \n\n2. PATTERN THAT WORKS FOR ALL: Crop the region above the full-row of color 7, keep the shape, and recolor its nonzero pixels to color 8 (all examples show the top block extracted and nonzero -> 8).  \n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: rows 0-5 cropped; 2 -> 8; background 0 stays 0.  \n- Ex2: rows 0-5 cropped; 2 -> 8; zeros remain 0.  \n- Ex3: rows 0-5 cropped; 2 -> 8; shape preserved.  \n- Ex4: rows 0-5 cropped; 2 -> 8; background unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT ===\nAll inputs share the same layout: rows 0-5 contain a red region (color 2) on black (0), row 6 is all 7, rows 7-12 contain a different region in color 6. Only the shapes/positions of the color-2 and color-6 objects change.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT ===\nEvery output is a 6x4 block, background 0, with a single connected object drawn in color 8 that matches a transformed input object's adjacency pattern.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT ===\nRule that fits all: extract the 6x4 block above the row of 7s (rows 0-5), map 2 -> 8, and flip it vertically (top?bottom).\n\n1) Reference objects: the full horizontal row of 7s (row 6) is fixed and partitions the grid. The top 6x4 block above that row is the reference region that is preserved.\n\n2) Grid pattern: for every example take the 6x4 block above the 7s, isolate the red connected component(s) (color 2), recolor them to 8, leave other cells black (0). Output = that transformed 6x4.\n\n3) Objects: the top red region (color 2) is the critical recurring object; the row of 7s is the fixed divider.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF there exists a row in the input grid such that every cell in that row has color 7, THEN mark the index of that row as divider_row.\n\nStep 2: IF divider_row is marked, THEN set cropped_region to be all cells with row index r where 0 <= r < divider_row and all column indices c (i.e., the rectangular region consisting of every row strictly above the full-7 row).\n\nStep 3: IF there are multiple rows that satisfy \"every cell is color 7\", THEN choose the topmost such row as divider_row (the smallest row index).\n\nStep 4: IF a cell (r,c) is in cropped_region AND its color in the input is 2, THEN set the corresponding output cell (r,c) to color 8.\n\nStep 5: IF a cell (r,c) is in cropped_region AND its color in the input is not 2, THEN set the corresponding output cell (r,c) to color 0.\n\nStep 6: IF a cell is in the divider_row or below the divider_row (r >= divider_row), THEN do not include that cell in the output (discard rows divider_row and below).\n\nStep 7: IF the final output is produced, THEN make the output grid exactly the transformed cropped_region with the same number of columns as the input and with rows 0..divider_row-1 (no padding or shifting).\n",
