    "raw_analysis": "- Puzzle type: input < output; all examples scale 3x3 → 9x9 (×3).\n- Ex1 VIS: 3×3 motif repeated as 3×3 block array placed per input pattern.\n- Ex1 GRID: colors 6,0; rule: each nonzero input cell becomes a 3×3 block equal to the input pattern; zero cells produce blank blocks.\n- Ex2 VIS: same tiling behavior (motif placed at bright input cell positions).\n- Ex2 GRID: colors 4,0; same cell→block substitution.\n- Ex3 VIS: motif tiled into corners/positions matching input nonzeros.\n- Ex3 GRID: colors 2,0; same rule.\n- Ex4 VIS: full-row and partial-row blocks repeated in 3×3 grid.\n- Ex4 GRID: colors 2,0; same rule.\n- Ex5 VIS: complex shape replicated as blocks at input-colored positions.\n- Ex5 GRID: colors 7,0; same cell→pattern block substitution.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs are 3×3 with one nonzero color on 0 background; they differ only in which cells are filled and which color.\n- That filled-cell pattern is the motif that determines output placement.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Every output is 9×9 tiled by 3×3 blocks.\n- Rule: nonzero input cell → corresponding 3×3 block = the 3×3 input motif in that color; zero → all-0 block. Test must follow this.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Ex1: 6 → 3×3 motif in 6; 0 → blank.\n- Ex2: 4 → same.\n- Ex3: 2 → same.\n- Ex4: 2 → same.\n- Ex5: 7 → same.\n\n=== COLOR REFERENCE ===\n- 0 background; motif colors 6,4,2,7 preserved.\n\n- Reference objects:\n  - The 3×3 motif of nonzero pixels (cells of color ≠0) is invariant and copied intact.\n  - Each nonzero input cell is a placement marker: copy the motif into the corresponding 3×3 block in the 9×9 output.\n\n- Whole-grid patterns:\n  - Output = 3×3 array of 3×3 blocks; a block contains the motif iff input(i,j) ≠ color 0.\n  - Background stays color 0; no rotation/flip of motif.\n\n- Object analysis:\n  - Primary object = the connected nonzero motif.\n  - Recurs repeatedly at block positions matching input nonzero cells.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nOutput is a 9×9 grid formed as a 3×3 array of 3×3 blocks (each input cell maps to one 3×3 block). Extract the 3×3 motif as the pattern of nonzero pixels in the input (the shape of cells ≠ 0). For each input cell: if the cell's value is nonzero (color c), copy that motif into the corresponding 3×3 block and set the filled pixels of that block to color c; if the input cell is 0, make the corresponding 3×3 block all 0. The motif is copied intact (no rotation or flip) and all other pixels remain color 0.\n",
