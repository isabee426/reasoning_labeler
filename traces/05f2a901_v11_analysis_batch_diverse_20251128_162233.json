    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Grid size unchanged (input/output same dims, 1:1); objects are translated.\n\n2) PATTERN: The connected region of color 2 is rigidly translated (no rotation/flip) until it becomes adjacent (touching) the stationary 2x2 color-8 block; color 8 stays fixed.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 2's shift right 3 cols to abut 8's; 8's unchanged.\n- Ex2: 2's shift down 6 rows to touch 8's; 8's unchanged.\n- Ex3: 2's shift up 3 rows to contact 8's; 8's unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs contain one connected region of color 2 and one 2x2 block of color 8. They differ only in the relative placement of the 2-region vs the 8-block (2 is left/above/below in different examples).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- In every output the 8 block remains at its input coordinates unchanged. The 2-region keeps its shape and orientation but is translated so it is orthogonally adjacent to the 8 block (shares an edge), grid size unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: rigid translation of the entire connected color-2 region (no rotation/flip) toward the color-8 block until the two objects become edge-adjacent; leave the 8-block fixed.\n\n1) Reference objects: the 2x2 color-8 block stays fixed and anchors the transform; its absolute position doesn't change.  \n2) Grid pattern: a pure translation (no rotation/flip) that moves the connected color-2 region so it becomes adjacent/touches the fixed 2x2 color-8 block.  \n3) Objects: two recurring items — one connected color-2 blob and one 2x2 color-8 square; the 2-blob is the moved object.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF there exists a 2x2 block whose four cells are color 8 (i.e., a contiguous 2x2 square of color is exactly 8) THEN mark that 2x2 color-8 block as the immovable anchor and do not change those four cells.\n\nStep 2: IF there exists a single connected region (orthogonally connected) of cells of color 2 THEN mark that connected color-2 region as the movable object and record its exact shape and orientation; do not change its cell colors while moving.\n\nStep 3: IF the marked color-2 region already shares an orthogonal edge with any cell of the marked 2x2 color-8 block (i.e., at least one 2 cell is directly above, below, left, or right of an 8 cell) THEN do nothing to the color-2 region (leave it in place).\n\nStep 4: IF the marked color-2 region does not share an orthogonal edge with the 2x2 color-8 block THEN compute the integer translation vector (dx,dy) of smallest Manhattan length such that translating every cell of the color-2 region by (dx,dy) produces at least one cell of the color-2 region that is orthogonally adjacent (shares an edge) to at least one cell of the 2x2 color-8 block.\n\nStep 5: IF the computed smallest translation vector (dx,dy) would place any translated color-2 cell directly into a cell currently occupied by the 2x2 color-8 block (i.e., cause overlap) THEN reduce the magnitude of the translation along that direction by the minimal integer amount so that after translation no color-2 cell overlaps an 8 cell but at least one color-2 cell is orthogonally adjacent to an 8 cell.\n\nStep 6: IF a unique smallest valid translation vector (dx,dy) exists per Steps 4–5 THEN move every cell of the marked color-2 region rigidly by that exact (dx,dy) (i.e., clear the original color-2 cells and set the translated coordinates to color 2), preserving the region’s shape and orientation.\n\nStep 7: IF any cells are not part of the marked 2-region or the marked 2x2 8-block THEN leave those cells’ colors unchanged (do not create, delete, or recolor any other cells).\n",
