    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Pure translation of the colored shape(s); input/output grid sizes identical and object sizes unchanged.\n\n2) PATTERN: The connected region of color 2 is translated (no rotation/flip) until it is orthogonally adjacent (touching edge-to-edge) to the fixed 2x2 color-8 block; color 8 and background (0) stay put.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: color2 shifted right 3 cols to abut color8; 8 unchanged.\n- Ex2: color2 shifted down 6 rows to abut color8 from above; 8 unchanged.\n- Ex3: color2 shifted up 3 rows to abut color8 from below; 8 unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Same: each input has one connected region of color 2 and one 2x2 block of color 8; the color-2 shape/orientation is identical across examples.\n- Different: their relative positions (offsets) vary.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: every output leaves the color-8 2x2 block in place and preserves the color-2 shape and all other pixels.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: translate the connected color-2 region (no rotation/flip) so it becomes adjacent (shares a side) to the color-8 2x2 block without overlapping; color-8 unchanged.\n\nReference objects: The two colored regions (the irregular color-2 connected shape and the 2x2 color-8 block) remain identical in shape, size and color -- they are the anchors that determine the move.\n\nGrid pattern: A uniform pure translation is applied to both objects together; their relative offset/orientation is preserved.\n\nObjects: The key recurring objects are the irregular color-2 polyomino and the 2x2 color-8 square; the transformation copies/translates them as a pair.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF there exists a contiguous 2x2 block composed of color 8 (four orthogonally adjacent cells forming a square) THEN do not move or recolor any of those color-8 cells (treat the 2x2 color-8 block as a fixed anchor).  \n2. Step 2: IF there exists a single connected region composed solely of color 2 cells (one connected color-2 object) THEN treat that connected region as one rigid object and preserve its exact shape and color (do not rotate or reflect it).  \n3. Step 3: IF the color-2 object's bounding box satisfies max_col_of_color2 < min_col_of_the_2x2_color8_block THEN translate the entire connected color-2 object right (no rotation/flip) until max_col_of_color2 = min_col_of_the_2x2_color8_block - 1 (i.e., until some color-2 cell is orthogonally adjacent edge-to-edge to the left side of the 2x2 color-8 block).  \n4. Step 4: IF the color-2 object's bounding box satisfies min_col_of_color2 > max_col_of_the_2x2_color8_block THEN translate the entire connected color-2 object left (no rotation/flip) until min_col_of_color2 = max_col_of_the_2x2_color8_block + 1 (i.e., until some color-2 cell is orthogonally adjacent edge-to-edge to the right side of the 2x2 color-8 block).  \n5. Step 5: IF the color-2 object's bounding box satisfies max_row_of_color2 < min_row_of_the_2x2_color8_block THEN translate the entire connected color-2 object down (no rotation/flip) until max_row_of_color2 = min_row_of_the_2x2_color8_block - 1 (i.e., until some color-2 cell is orthogonally adjacent edge-to-edge above the 2x2 color-8 block).  \n6. Step 6: IF the color-2 object's bounding box satisfies min_row_of_color2 > max_row_of_the_2x2_color8_block THEN translate the entire connected color-2 object up (no rotation/flip) until min_row_of_color2 = max_row_of_the_2x2_color8_block + 1 (i.e., until some color-2 cell is orthogonally adjacent edge-to-edge below the 2x2 color-8 block).  \n7. Step 7: IF any other cells (colors other than 2 or 8, including background 0) are present in the grid THEN leave those cells unchanged.\n",
