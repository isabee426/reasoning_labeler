The rest is generated by repeating that motif.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input grid is 7x7 THEN proceed to extract the pattern colors.  \n2. Step 2: IF a cell (r,c) in the input has color != 0 AND (r + c) mod 3 = 0 THEN set seq[0] to that cell's color (use any such nonzero cell to determine seq[0]).  \n3. Step 3: IF a cell (r,c) in the input has color != 0 AND (r + c) mod 3 = 1 THEN set seq[1] to that cell's color (use any such nonzero cell to determine seq[1]).  \n4. Step 4: IF a cell (r,c) in the input has color != 0 AND (r + c) mod 3 = 2 THEN set seq[2] to that cell's color (use any such nonzero cell to determine seq[2]).  \n5. Step 5: IF after Steps 2–4 any seq[k] remains unset THEN assign the remaining distinct nonzero input color(s) to the unset seq entries so that seq contains exactly the three distinct nonzero colors from the input.  \n6. Step 6: IF producing the output grid THEN for every output cell at coordinates (r,c) set its color to seq[(r + c) mod 3] (use the numeric color from seq).  \n7. Step 7: IF any input cell was 0 (background) or nonzero, THEN overwrite all cells in the output with the tiling from Step 6 so the final output is a full 7x7 periodic tiling from seq.\n",
