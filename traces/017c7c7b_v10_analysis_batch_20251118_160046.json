This fits all examples.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1) Recolor every 1 → 2 and leave 0 unchanged. 2) Preserve the 3-column object geometry (rows and columns of nonzero pixels) exactly, only changing color. 3) Increase the height from 6 to 9 by appending a copy of the 3-row vertical motif from the input whose first and third rows are identical (the three-row repeating unit of the vertical stripe). 4) The output is therefore a 3×9 grid: the original six rows recolored (1→2) followed by the appended 3-row motif recolored the same way.\n",
