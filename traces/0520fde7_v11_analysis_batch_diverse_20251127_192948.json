PATTERN: Split input at the orange column into left (cols0–2) and right (cols4–6) 3x3 blocks; output = cellwise AND of where both blocks have color1; those intersection cells become color2, all else 0.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: cells (0,1),(1,2),(2,1) are 1 in both blocks → set to 2; others 0.\n- Ex2: only (1,1) common → set to 2; others 0.\n- Ex3: (1,0) and (2,2) common → set to 2; others 0.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT ===\nAll inputs are 3x7 with an orange column (5) at col3 splitting two 3x3 blocks (cols0-2 and cols4-6). Each block varies in placement of blue (1) vs black (0).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT ===\nAll outputs are 3x3 using only colors 0 and red(2); red pixels mark specific cells (same rule each example).\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT ===\nRule: output[x,y]=2 iff left_block[x,y]==1 AND right_block[x,y]==1 (both are color 1). Else 0.\n\n- Reference objects: the orange divider column (col 3) is constant and defines two reference 3x3 regions (cols0-2 and cols4-6). These regions keep orientation and index mapping.\n\n- Grid pattern: output is a 3x3 grid where each cell = 1 iff the corresponding cells in the left AND right 3x3 blocks are filled (pixelwise AND). Filled outputs use color 2.\n\n- Objects: the two blue 3x3 shapes are key; their overlapping cells (intersection) are the recurring, decisive features.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input grid has dimensions 3x7 AND column index 3 (the fourth column) is filled with color 5 in all three rows THEN treat column 3 as a fixed divider and proceed to split the grid into two side blocks.\n\n2. Step 2: IF there is a fixed divider at column 3 (color 5) in a 3x7 input THEN define the left_block as the 3x3 subgrid composed of input rows 0-2 and columns 0-2 and define the right_block as the 3x3 subgrid composed of input rows 0-2 and columns 4-6.\n\n3. Step 3: IF left_block is a 3x3 block AND right_block is a 3x3 block THEN create an output grid of size 3x3 initialized with color 0 in every cell.\n\n4. Step 4: IF a cell is at position (r,c) with r in {0,1,2} and c in {0,1,2} in the left_block AND the corresponding cell at position (r,c) in the right_block is color 1 AND the left_block cell is color 1 THEN set the output cell at position (r,c) to color 2.\n\n5. Step 5: IF for a given position (r,c) either the left_block cell at (r,c) is not color 1 OR the right_block cell at (r,c) is not color 1 THEN set the output cell at (r,c) to color 0.\n\n6. Step 6: IF all 3x3 output cells have been set according to Steps 4–5 THEN preserve the row/column orientation so that output row r and column c correspond directly to input rows r and columns (0-2 or 4-6 respectively).\n\n7. Step 7: IF the output 3x3 grid has been filled by the above rules THEN return that 3x3 grid as the final result (only colors 0 and 2 will appear, with 2 marking positions where both side blocks had color 1).\n",
