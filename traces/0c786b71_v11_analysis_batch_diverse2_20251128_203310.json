Layout differs but each has a central cross-like feature.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All outputs are 6x8, color values preserved (same numbers), and exhibit 4-fold symmetry (mirror across vertical & horizontal axes). Border repetition and a central enlarged block are identical properties.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- For all examples: scale input 2x in both dims (each input cell -> 2x2 block), keep colors identical, then mirror/reflect that scaled block into four quadrants to produce full horizontal+vertical symmetry.\n\nReference objects: the input's cross/T and four corner blocks remain spatial anchors; their relative placement is preserved and drives color reassignment.\n\nGrid pattern: every example is uniformly scaled 2x in both axes (3x4 -> 6x8). The layout is expanded into 2x2 tiles, then colors are permuted by region (corners, edge ring, central cross).\n\nObjects: the critical recurring objects are the 2x2 upscaled tiles, the central cross (vertical bar + horizontal arm) and four corner blocks -- these are recolored consistently across examples.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF the input grid is size 3x4 THEN create an output grid of size 6x8 (scale factor 2 in both dimensions) initialized empty.  \nStep 2: IF an input cell is at position (r,c) with color X (r in {0,1,2}, c in {0,1,2,3}) THEN place a 2x2 tile of color X into the output at rows [2r,2r+1] and columns [2c,2c+1].  \nStep 3: IF a 2x2 tile in the output came from the input position (0,0) (top-left) THEN circularly shift (wrap-around) the entire 6x8 output grid down by 2 rows and right by 3 columns so the (0,0) tile moves to rows [2,3] and cols [3,4].  \nStep 4: IF a cell in the (possibly shifted) output at (r,c) has color X THEN set the three mirrored positions (r, 7-c), (5-r, c), and (5-r, 7-c) to color X (make horizontal, vertical and 180deg reflections identical), preserving X.  \nStep 5: IF multiple assignments attempt to write different colors into the same cell during Steps 2-4 THEN prefer the color assigned by the tile that originated from input position (0,0), otherwise keep the last assigned color from the procedure order (Step 2 then Step 3 then Step 4).  \nStep 6: IF any cell of the output remains unset after Steps 2-5 THEN set it to the color of its nearest neighbor that was set (choose the neighbor by Manhattan distance; if tie choose the neighbor with smaller row index).\n",
