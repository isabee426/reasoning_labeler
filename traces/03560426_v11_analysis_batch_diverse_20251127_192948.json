    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Size unchanged (10x10→10x10), ratio 1:1.\n\n2) PATTERN: Take the distinct colored connected blocks (ordered left→right in the input), copy their shapes unchanged and paste them sequentially starting at the top-left, shifting each block down-right to form a diagonal/stair; later blocks overpaint earlier ones where they overlap.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 8 moves to top-left (shape preserved), 7 placed down-right of 8, 2 further down-right; overlaps: 2/7 overpaint underlying.\n- Ex2: 1→top-left, 2→down-right of 1, 3→further, 4→furthest (vertical); shapes preserved, layered.\n- Ex3: 4→top-left, 2 (vertical)→down-right, 3 (3x3)→further down-right; shapes preserved and layered.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs have several nonzero connected blocks aligned near the bottom in left→right order. They differ in block count, sizes and colors (ex1: 8,7,2; ex2: 1,2,3,4; ex3: 4,2,3).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Every output preserves each block's color and shape, moves all blocks into the upper-left, leaving the rest 0. Order is preserved (left→right in input becomes a sequence placed from top-left downward/rightward).\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: copy each distinct connected block (colors kept: e.g. 8,7,2; 1,2,3,4; 4,2,3) in left→right order and paste them, orientation unchanged, into the grid at the first available position scanning row-major, avoiding overlap.\n\nReference objects: The distinct connected colored blocks (their shape, color, and left→right order) remain unchanged and guide placement.\n\nGrid pattern: For every input, shift the blocks from the bottom row into the upper-left area, placing them in sequence along a southeast diagonal (staircase), each object positioned southeast of the previous.\n\nObjects: The recurring objects are the separate bottom-aligned colored blocks; preserve shape/orientation and arrange them into a touching diagonal stack.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a set of nonzero cells forms a 4-connected connected region (an object) THEN treat that connected region (its exact shape and color) as an atomic object to be copied and record its bounding box (top_row, left_col, height, width) and its color C (where C is the integer color value).\n\n2. Step 2: IF an object has the smallest bounding-box left_col among all objects (i.e., it is the leftmost object) THEN translate that object so its bounding-box top-left moves to (row=0, col=0) by moving it up by min_row units and left by min_col units (atomic action: \"move up X units and left Y units\").\n\n3. Step 3: IF an object is the k-th object in increasing left_col order (k>1) and P is the (k-1)-th object already placed THEN place this k-th object by translating it so its bounding-box top_row becomes P.top_row + P.height and its bounding-box left_col becomes P.left_col + P.width - 1 (atomic action: \"move down by (P.top_row + P.height - original_top_row_of_object) units and right by (P.left_col + P.width -1 - original_left_col_of_object) units\").\n\n4. Step 4: IF translating an object (by the amounts in Steps 2–3) would place any of its cells outside the 10x10 grid THEN clip those object cells that fall outside the grid (atomic action: \"do not draw cells outside the grid\").\n\n5. Step 5: IF two or more objects occupy the same grid cell after placement (overlap) THEN set that cell to the color of the object that appears later in the left->right input order (atomic action: \"overwrite underlying color with later object's color\").\n\n6. Step 6: IF a grid cell is not occupied by any placed object after all translations THEN set that cell to 0 (atomic action: \"set to color 0\").\n\n7. Step 7: IF all objects have been placed and overlaps resolved according to Step 5 THEN output the resulting 10x10 grid (atomic action: \"return the grid with only the translated objects and zeros elsewhere\").\n",
