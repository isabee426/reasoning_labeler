    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION: 10x10 → 10x10 (same); connected regions of color 5 are recolored, no scaling.\n\n2) PATTERN: In every example each connected color-5 region is recolored to the top-row single-pixel color by horizontal order (left marker→left blob, middle→middle, right→right). Other pixels unchanged.\n\n3) CHANGES:\nEx1: 5 → left:1, middle-bottom:4, right:7.\nEx2: 5 → left:2, middle:6, right:8.\nEx3: 5 → left:1, middle:6, right:7.\n\nStage1: puzzle type = recolor blobs; visual = three top markers; grid = color-5 blobs mapped to those markers.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs are 10x10, contain multiple distinct connected regions of color 5 and three single-pixel nonzero markers in row 0. Marker colors: ex1 {1,4,7}, ex2 {2,6,8}, ex3 {1,6,7}. Other non-5 pixels' positions vary but exist.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- In every output the top-row markers and all non-5 pixels are unchanged. Each original connected 5 region is recolored uniformly.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: for each connected region of color 5, recolor all its cells to the color of the single nonzero pixel in row 0 whose column falls inside that region’s horizontal span (uses the marker colors listed above).\n\n1) REFERENCE OBJECTS: The three single‑pixel markers in row 0 never change; they act as color labels tied to their columns.\n\n2) GRID PATTERN: For every case, recolor each connected region of color 5 to the color of the top‑row marker whose column falls inside that region's horizontal span. No resizing or moving.\n\n3) OBJECTS: Most important are the connected color‑5 regions (targets) and the three top‑row single‑pixel markers (labels). Other pixels remain unchanged.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a pixel is in row 0 AND its color is not 0 THEN record that pixel as a label marker by storing its column index and its color, and leave that pixel's color unchanged.  \n2. Step 2: IF a pixel's color is 5 THEN treat that pixel as belonging to a connected region (object) defined by orthogonal adjacency of color-5 pixels (the entire connected set is one object), and do not change any pixels yet.  \n3. Step 3: IF an object is a connected region of color 5 THEN compute and record the object's horizontal span as min_col and max_col (the smallest and largest column indices occupied by any pixel of that object).  \n4. Step 4: IF a label marker exists at column c such that min_col <= c <= max_col for a given color-5 object THEN change the color of every pixel in that connected color-5 object to the color of the label marker at column c.  \n5. Step 5: IF two or more label markers satisfy min_col <= c <= max_col for the same color-5 object THEN choose the leftmost such marker (the one with the smallest column index) and change the color of every pixel in the object to that leftmost marker's color.  \n6. Step 6: IF no label marker has a column c with min_col <= c <= max_col for a color-5 object THEN leave that color-5 object unchanged (do not recolor it).  \n7. Step 7: IF a pixel is not color 5 AND is not a row-0 label marker (color != 0 in row 0) THEN leave that pixel's color unchanged.\n",
