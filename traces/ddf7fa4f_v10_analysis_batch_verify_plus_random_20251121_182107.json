Shapes/locations of connected color-5 regions differ.\n- Same: each input has several distinct connected regions of color 5 and three single nonzero pixels on row0.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: row0 and all non-5 pixels unchanged; each 5-region keeps shape/position but is uniformly recolored to a row0 color.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: For every connected region of color 5, recolor it to the color of the single nonzero pixel on row 0 whose column lies inside that region's horizontal bounding box.\n\n- Reference objects: The single-pixel colored markers on row0 stay unchanged and serve as color references for columns.\n\n- Grid pattern: For every connected region of color 5, recolor the entire region to the color of the row‑0 marker whose column falls inside that region's horizontal span (bbox).\n\n- Objects: Key objects = connected 5-regions (targets) and the top-row markers (sources).\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a pixel is on row 0 AND its color is not 0 AND its color is not 5 THEN leave that pixel's color unchanged.  \nStep 2: IF a group of orthogonally connected pixels all have color 5 THEN identify that group as a distinct connected region and compute its horizontal span as the inclusive range [min_col, max_col] of its column indices.  \nStep 3: IF a connected region of color 5 has exactly one pixel on row 0 whose column c satisfies min_col <= c <= max_col AND the pixel at (row 0, c) has color != 0 THEN change the color of every pixel in that connected region to the color value of the pixel at (row 0, c).  \nStep 4: IF a connected region of color 5 has zero OR more than one nonzero pixel on row 0 whose column falls inside its horizontal span THEN leave the colors of every pixel in that connected region unchanged.  \nStep 5: IF a pixel's color is not 5 AND it is not a nonzero pixel on row 0 (i.e., any other pixel) THEN leave that pixel's color unchanged.\n",
