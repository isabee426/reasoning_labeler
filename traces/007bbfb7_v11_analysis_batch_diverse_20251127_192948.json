    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: 3x upscaling: 3x3 → 9x9 (each input cell maps to a 3x3 block), ratio consistent.\n\n2. PATTERN: For every cell with color c≠0 at (r,c) the output places a 3x3 block at block (r,c) equal to the input pattern with its colored pixels set to c and zeros kept 0; zero input cells yield empty blocks.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 6 at (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(2,1),(2,2) → 3x3 copies with 6; others 0.\n- Ex2: 4 at (0,0),(0,2),(2,1) → 3x3 copies with 4.\n- Ex3: 2 at (1,2),(2,0),(2,2) → 3x3 copies with 2.\n- Ex4: 2 at (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(2,1),(2,2) → 3x3 copies with 2.\n- Ex5: 7 at (0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2) → 3x3 copies with 7.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll inputs are 3x3, each has a single nonzero color (exs: 6,4,2,2,7). They differ in which cells are nonzero and the shape of that 3x3 pattern.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll outputs are 9x9 partitioned into 3x3 blocks. Each block is either all zeros or an exact copy of the entire 3x3 input pattern. Background zeros and the input pattern’s colors are preserved.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nRule: For every input cell (r,c): if value=c!=0 place the whole 3x3 input pattern as the 3x3 block at block position (r,c); if input(r,c)=0 place a 3x3 zero block. Colors unchanged.\n\nReference objects: the entire 3x3 input pattern (colors & arrangement) remains identical and is the reusable tile.\n\nGrid pattern: output is a 3x upscaling into a 9x9 3x3 tile grid. Each input cell maps to one 3x3 tile: if that cell ≠0, place a full copy of the whole input pattern in that tile; if 0, leave the tile black.\n\nObjects: the dominant object is the whole input pattern; individual nonzero input cells act as selectors for where to place those tiles.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input grid is a 3x3 array THEN create an output grid of size 9x9 initialized with color 0.  \n2. Step 2: IF a cell at coordinates (r,c) in the input has color v AND v != 0 (r and c are 0-indexed with 0 ≤ r,c ≤ 2) THEN treat the entire 3x3 input as a template pattern where a template pixel is \"on\" if its input value != 0 and \"off\" if its input value = 0.  \n3. Step 3: IF the condition in Step 2 holds for cell (r,c) with color v THEN place a 3x3 block into the output with top-left corner at row 3*r and column 3*c such that for each template coordinate (i,j) (0 ≤ i,j ≤ 2) the output pixel at (3*r + i, 3*c + j) is set to v if the input at (i,j) != 0, otherwise set to 0.  \n4. Step 4: IF a cell at coordinates (r,c) in the input has color 0 THEN leave the 3x3 output block with top-left at (3*r,3*c) filled with color 0 (no pixels changed).  \n5. Step 5: IF there are multiple input cells with v != 0 THEN apply Steps 2–3 independently for each such cell (each input cell produces its own 3x3 block in the corresponding output block).  \n6. Step 6: IF two placements would write to the same output pixel (this cannot occur because input-to-output blocks are non-overlapping) THEN resolve by keeping the last-written color (not needed for the given 3x3→9x9 tiling because blocks are disjoint).  \n7. Step 7: IF all input cells have been processed as above THEN return the 9x9 output grid.\n",
