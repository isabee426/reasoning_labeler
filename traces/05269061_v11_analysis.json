The sparse diagonal colors are expanded to fill the grid.\n\n2) PATTERN: Extract the three nonzero diagonal colors and tile the entire grid with that 3-color cyclic pattern (period 3) across rows and columns, preserving their cyclic order.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: {1,2,4} → grid tiled as 2,4,1 repeating; zeros replaced.\n- Ex2: {2,8,3} → tiled 2,8,3 repeating.\n- Ex3: {4,8,3} → tiled 4,8,3 repeating.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Each input has exactly three nonzero colors: {1,2,4}, {2,8,3}, {4,8,3}.
