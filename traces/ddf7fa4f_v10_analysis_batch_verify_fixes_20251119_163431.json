    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Output is same 10x10 (1:1); shapes and positions of objects are preserved but color of each connected region of color 5 is changed.\n\n2) PATTERN: Every distinct connected region of color 5 is recolored to the color of the single-pixel header above/nearest horizontally (left header → left region, middle header → middle region, right header → right region). Other colors unchanged.\n\nPer example (Stage 1: puzzle type / visual / grid):\nEx1: recolor-5 rule; headers [1,4,7]; three 5-regions → colors [1 (left), 4 (middle-bottom), 7 (right)].\nEx2: recolor-5; headers [2,6,8]; three 5-regions → [2 (left), 6 (center), 8 (right)].\nEx3: recolor-5; headers [1,6,7]; three 5-regions → [1 (left), 6 (center), 7 (right)].\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll inputs are 10x10 with background 0 and connected regions colored 5. Each input also has three single colored pixels in row0 (example1: 1 at col1, 4 at col5, 7 at col8; ex2: 2@2,6@5,8@9; ex3: 1@1,6@5,7@8). Shape/position of 5-regions differ.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll outputs keep size and object positions. Row0 single pixels remain unchanged. Every 5-region is recolored, each region uniformly replaced by one of the row0 colors (no shape moves).\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nRule: for each distinct connected region of color 5, replace 5 with the color of the single pixel in row0 whose column lies inside that region's horizontal span (e.g. left region→color at col1, middle→col5, right→col8).\n\nREFERENCE OBJECTS: three single pixels on the top row remain fixed and provide the target colors. Shapes/positions of 5-regions remain unchanged.\n\nGRID PATTERNS: For all examples, each connected region of color 5 is repainted with one of the top-row pixel colors. Mapping is by horizontal order: left top pixel -> leftmost 5-region, middle -> middle region, right -> rightmost region.\n\nOBJECTS: The three 5-connected regions are the key recurring objects; use their left-to-right ordering (e.g. by min/max column or centroid) to assign the three top colors. Background and other colored single pixels stay the same.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a pixel is in row 0 AND its color ≠ 0 AND it is a single-pixel connected component (no orthogonally adjacent same-color pixels) THEN mark that pixel as a header and record its color and its column index.\n\nStep 2: IF a set of one or more orthogonally connected pixels all have color 5 THEN treat that set as a distinct connected region-object (a color-5 region) and compute its bounding box and leftmost column (min_col).\n\nStep 3: IF you have identified all color-5 regions THEN sort those color-5 regions by their leftmost column (min_col) to obtain a left, middle, and right region in horizontal order.\n\nStep 4: IF a color-5 region is the left region in the horizontal order THEN change the color of every pixel in that region to the color of the header whose column index is the smallest among the recorded header columns (the left header color).\n\nStep 5: IF a color-5 region is the middle region in the horizontal order THEN change the color of every pixel in that region to the color of the header whose column index is the middle value among the recorded header columns (the middle header color).\n\nStep 6: IF a color-5 region is the right region in the horizontal order THEN change the color of every pixel in that region to the color of the header whose column index is the largest among the recorded header columns (the right header color).\n\nStep 7: IF a pixel is not part of a color-5 region OR is a pixel in row 0 marked as a header THEN leave its color unchanged.\n",
