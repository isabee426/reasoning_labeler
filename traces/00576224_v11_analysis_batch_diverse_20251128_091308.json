Step 1: IF the salient object in the input is exactly a 2x2 block (cells at input rows 0–1 and cols 0–1) THEN create an output grid of size 6x6 to receive the transformed pattern.  \n2. Step 2: IF a cell exists in the input at position (r_in,c_in) where r_in ∈ {0,1} and c_in ∈ {0,1} THEN refer to its color value (a digit 0–9) as \"the color of input(r_in,c_in)\" for use when writing output cells.  \n3. Step 3: IF a target tile-row index r_tile ∈ {0,1,2} is even (r_tile mod 2 = 0) THEN for every tile-column c_tile ∈ {0,1,2} and every input cell (r_in,c_in) set output cell at (r_out = r_tile*2 + r_in, c_out = c_tile*2 + c_in) to the color of input(r_in,c_in).  \n4. Step 4: IF a target tile-row index r_tile ∈ {0,1,2} is odd (r_tile mod 2 = 1) THEN for every tile-column c_tile ∈ {0,1,2} and every input cell (r_in,c_in) set output cell at (r_out = r_tile*2 + r_in, c_out = c_tile*2 + (1 - c_in)) to the color of input(r_in,c_in) (i.e., place a horizontally flipped copy of the 2x2 input in that tile-row).  \n5. Step 5: IF any output cell is not written by Steps 3–4 THEN leave that output cell as the original background color (do not introduce new colors).  \n6. Step 6: IF the input 2x2 uses particular color digits (for example a= color of input(0,0), b= color of input(0,1), c= color of input(1,0), d= color of input(1,1)) THEN every 2x2 tile placed by Steps 3–4 preserves those exact digits (no recoloring) so the final 6x6 equals a 3×3 grid of 2x2 tiles that alternate between the original 2x2 and its horizontal mirror on odd tile-rows.\n",
