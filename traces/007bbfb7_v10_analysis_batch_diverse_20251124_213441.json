    "raw_analysis": "1. Transformation: upscale by factor 3 (3x3 -> 9x9), same ratio in both dimensions.\n\n2. Pattern: each input cell becomes a 3x3 block: a 0 cell -> 3x3 zeros; a nonzero cell (color X) -> a 3x3 copy of the entire original 3x3 input (preserving its colors). The 3x3 block-placement pattern equals the input mask.\n\nEx1: color 6 cells -> 3x3 copies of the original input; zeros -> zero blocks.\nEx2: color 4 -> same.\nEx3: color 2 -> same.\nEx4: color 2 -> same.\nEx5: color 7 -> same.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll inputs are 3x3. Each example has one nonzero color (6,4,2,2,7) and different arrangements of zeros vs that color.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll outputs are 9x9, partitioned into 3x3 blocks. Every 3x3 block is either all zeros or a 3x3 copy of the entire 3x3 input pattern (with nonzero positions preserved).\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nRule: upscale by 3. For each input cell (i,j): if 0 → place a 3x3 zero block at rows 3i..3i+2,cols 3j..3j+2. If C≠0 → place a 3x3 copy of the input pattern there, with its nonzero entries set to color C.\n\nREFERENCE OBJECTS: The 3x3 input foreground pattern (which cells are nonzero and its color) is the template and is preserved.\n\nGRID PATTERNS: Output = 9x9 = 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. For each input cell (i,j) place a 3x3 block: if input(i,j) is background → block all background; if nonzero → copy the entire 3x3 input pattern into that block, using the cell's color.\n\nOBJECTS: The important object is the input's foreground shape; it is repeatedly tiled into blocks at every nonzero input position.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF the input grid size is 3x3 THEN create an output grid sized 9x9 (scale factor 3) and initialize all its cells to color 0.\n\nStep 2: IF a specific input cell is at position (i,j) (0-indexed) AND its color is 0 THEN set every cell in the output block with rows 3*i..3*i+2 and columns 3*j..3*j+2 to color 0.\n\nStep 3: IF a specific input cell is at position (i,j) AND its color C is nonzero (C ≠ 0) THEN fill the output block with rows 3*i..3*i+2 and columns 3*j..3*j+2 by copying the entire 3x3 input grid into that block, preserving each input cell's color values exactly (including zeros and nonzero colors).\n\nStep 4: IF a cell inside the copied 3x3 block corresponds to a zero in the original input THEN set that block cell to 0 (i.e., zeros in the template remain zeros in every copied block).\n\nStep 5: IF a cell inside the copied 3x3 block corresponds to a nonzero color D in the original input THEN set that block cell to color D (i.e., nonzero colors in the template are reproduced exactly in every copied block).\n\nStep 6: IF the input contains exactly one nonzero color X THEN every copied 3x3 block produced by Step 3 will contain color X in the same relative positions as the original input, yielding repeated tiled copies of the original 3x3 pattern at each nonzero input position.\n",
