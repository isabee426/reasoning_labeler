This rule holds for both examples.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: Colors preserved {7,9,4,3}; middle 2-row band flips columns (7↔9, 4↔3); top/bottom repeat original.\n- Ex2: Colors preserved {8,6,4}; middle band flips columns ([8,6]->[6,8], [6,4]->[4,6]); top/bottom repeat original.\n\nStage 1 summary:\n- Ex1: puzzle type = tiling+horizontal-flip; visual = 3×3 2×2 blocks; grid = rows 0,2 = input, row1 = horiz-flip.\n- Ex2: same analysis with colors 8,6,4.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Both inputs are 2×2 with layout [a b; c d]. Only color values differ (ex1: a=7,b=9,c=4,d=3; ex2: a=8,b=6,c=6,d=4).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Both outputs are 6×6 (scale factor 3), a 3×3 tiling of 2×2 blocks.

Colors are preserved.\n\n1) Reference objects: the 2x2 input tile [a b; c d] is the invariant unit. It is copied to form the output and therefore fully determines colors.\n\n2) Grid pattern: scale by 3 (2x2 → 6x6) as a 3×3 tiling of 2×2 tiles. Block-rows alternate: row-blocks 1 and 3 use the original tile, row-block 2 uses the horizontal mirror (swap columns). Columns in a block-row repeat identically.\n\n3) Objects: the 2×2 colored tile is the recurring object; its horizontal-flip variant recurs in every second block-row.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input grid has dimensions 2 by 2 THEN read and record the four input cell colors as a = color at (0,0), b = color at (0,1), c = color at (1,0), d = color at (1,1).\n\n2. Step 2: IF colors a,b,c,d are recorded THEN create an output grid of size 6 by 6 (three times larger in each dimension than the 2x2 input).\n\n3. Step 3: IF the output grid is 6x6 THEN partition it into nine 2x2 blocks indexed by block-row r ∈ {0,1,2} and block-col s ∈ {0,1,2}, where block (r,s) covers output rows [2*r, 2*r+1] and columns [2*s, 2*s+1].\n\n4. Step 4: IF a block has block-row r equal to 0 or 2 (i.e., r mod 2 = 0) THEN fill every cell of that 2x2 block with the original input tile layout: set top-left = a, top-right = b, bottom-left = c, bottom-right = d for that entire 2x2 block.\n\n5. Step 5: IF a block has block-row r equal to 1 (the middle block-row) THEN fill every cell of that 2x2 block with the horizontal mirror of the input tile: set top-left = b, top-right = a, bottom-left = d, bottom-right = c for that entire 2x2 block.\n\n6. Step 6: IF any 2x2 block is filled by Steps 4–5 THEN apply the same filling to all block-columns s = 0,1,2 so that blocks in the same block-row are identical (i.e., copy the filled 2x2 pattern to columns 0,1,2).\n\n7. Step 7: IF all nine 2x2 blocks are filled as above THEN the output is complete and contains only the colors {a,b,c,d} from the input, arranged as a 3×3 tiling of 2×2 tiles with the middle block-row horizontally flipped relative to the top and bottom block-rows.\n",
