    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: 3x upscale (3×3 → 9×9), consistent 3× scaling in both axes.  \n2. PATTERN: Every nonzero input cell becomes a 3×3 tile equal to the entire 3×3 input pattern (colors preserved); zero input cells become empty (all-0) 3×3 tiles.  \n3. KEY CHANGES:  \n- Ex1: input 6s produce 3×3 tiles reproducing the full input pattern in color 6; zeros → empty tiles.  \n- Ex2: input 4s seed tiles of the full input pattern in color 4; zeros stay empty.  \n- Ex3: input 2s seed tiles of the full input pattern in color 2; zeros stay empty.  \n- Ex4: input 2s seed tiles of the full input pattern in color 2; zeros stay empty.  \n- Ex5: input 7s seed tiles of the full input pattern in color 7; zeros stay empty.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT ===\nAll inputs are 3x3, each has one nonzero color (6,4,2,2,7) and 0 as background. Positions of nonzero cells differ.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT ===\nAll outputs are 9x9 partitioned into nine 3x3 blocks. Blocks for input zeros are all 0. Every block corresponding to a nonzero input cell contains the full 3x3 input pattern, painted in that example's color.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT ===\nRule: 3x upscale. For each input cell (i,j): if color c>0, write the entire 3x3 input pattern into output block (i*3..i*3+2, j*3..j*3+2) with nonzeros set to c; if 0, block stays zero.\n\nREF: The entire 3x3 input acts as the reference/template; its colored pixels and relative layout are preserved.\n\nGRID: Uniform 3x scaling to 9x9. For each nonzero input cell at (r,c) place a 3x3 copy of the whole 3x3 input into the output block (r,c). Copies are overlaid (logical OR).\n\nOBJECTS: Key objects = the input-template and the set of nonzero cell positions. Output = tiled repeats of the template at those positions.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input is a 3x3 block THEN create an output grid of size 9x9 initialized with color 0 (all cells set to 0).  \n2. Step 2: IF an input cell at coordinates (r,c) with r,c in {0,1,2} has color 0 THEN set every output cell with row in [3*r, 3*r+2] and column in [3*c, 3*c+2] to color 0.  \n3. Step 3: IF an input cell at (r,c) has a nonzero color c (c > 0) THEN treat the entire 3x3 input as the template to place at the output block for (r,c).  \n4. Step 4: IF placing the template for a nonzero input cell (r,c) with color c and the template position (i,j) with i,j in {0,1,2} has input(i,j) = 0 THEN set output(3*r + i, 3*c + j) = 0.  \n5. Step 5: IF placing the template for a nonzero input cell (r,c) with color c and the template position (i,j) has input(i,j) = t where t > 0 THEN set output(3*r + i, 3*c + j) = c.\n\n(Indices r,c,i,j are 0-indexed. In plain terms: partition the 9x9 output into nine 3x3 blocks corresponding to input cells; for each input cell that is zero make its block all zeros; for each input cell with color c>0 copy the full 3x3 input pattern into that block but replace every original nonzero pixel with c and keep template zeros as 0.)\n",
