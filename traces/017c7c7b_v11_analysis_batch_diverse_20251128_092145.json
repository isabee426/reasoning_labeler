Differences: location of branches and whether the 3-row vertical motif repeats (ex1 & ex3 repeat; ex2 does not).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll outputs are 3×9, every 1→2, 0 unchanged. The top 6 rows of each output equal the input with 1→2. Final 3 rows are a repeated 3-row segment from the input (extending the vertical pattern).\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAlways: recolor 1→2 and increase height from 6→9 by appending a 3-row copy of an earlier 3-row segment of the input object (thus extending the vertical pattern).\n\n1) Reference objects: The central vertical connected object (color1) — its column, shape and horizontal arms stay identical and drive the change.\n\n2) Grid pattern: Recolor 1→2, leave 0. Increase height 6→9 by duplicating a 3-row segment of the vertical object and appending it below, preserving connectivity and local arm positions.\n\n3) Objects: The vertical spine (middle column) is primary; horizontal protrusions are secondary but preserved and repeated when their segment is duplicated.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a cell's color is 1 in the input grid THEN change that cell's color to 2 in the output grid.  \nStep 2: IF a cell's color is 0 in the input grid THEN leave that cell's color as 0 in the output grid (do not change 0).  \nStep 3: IF the input grid has width 3 and height 6 THEN produce an output grid with the same width 3 and height 9 by appending three new rows below the original six rows.  \nStep 4: IF appending three new rows to the bottom (from Step 3) THEN fill the three new rows (output rows indices 6,7,8 using 0-indexing) by copying the input's top third (input rows indices 0,1,2 respectively) after applying Step 1 to those rows.  \nStep 5: IF a pixel is copied from an input row into an appended row (Step 4) THEN copy only the colors (after recolor 1->2) and do not move any pixels horizontally or vertically relative to the column positions.  \nStep 6: IF there is a contiguous vertical object of color 1 in the center column of the input (connected region touching multiple rows) THEN preserve that object's pattern (its occupied columns and any horizontal protrusions) when recoloring (1->2) and when copying the top three input rows into the appended rows.  \nStep 7: IF the input meets the conditions above (width 3, height 6, colors only 0 and 1) THEN the complete transformation is: recolor all 1->2 (Step 1), keep all 0 (Step 2), and append rows 0..2 (after recolor) to become output rows 6..8 (Steps 3–5), thereby producing a 3x9 output that preserves the columnar object and its horizontal arms.\n",
