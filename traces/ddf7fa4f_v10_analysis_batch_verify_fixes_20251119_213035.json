Every output has each original 5-region uniformly repainted.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: For each connected region of color 5, repaint all its cells to the color of the single nonzero pixel in row0 whose column lies within that region's horizontal span. (uses row0 colors: e.g. 1,4,7 or 2,6,8)\n\nReference objects: The three single nonzero pixels in the top row remain unchanged and serve as color references aligned to columns.\n\nGrid pattern: For every connected orange region (color 5), find which top-row single’s column falls inside that region’s horizontal span; repaint the entire region to that top pixel’s color. All other pixels unchanged.\n\nObjects: Recurring/critical objects = connected color-5 blocks; mapping is horizontal-span → top reference color.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a pixel is in row 0 and its color is not 0 THEN record its column index j and its color value c as a top-row reference (map column j -> color c).\n\n2. Step 2: IF a set of orthogonally connected cells all have color 5 THEN treat that set as a distinct region R and compute R's horizontal span [min_col, max_col] as the smallest and largest column indices of cells in R.\n\n3. Step 3: IF a distinct region R has exactly one recorded top-row reference whose column j satisfies min_col <= j <= max_col THEN change the color of every cell in R to the color value c of that referenced top-row pixel.\n\n4. Step 4: IF a distinct region R has more than one recorded top-row reference whose column lies within min_col <= j <= max_col THEN choose the reference with the smallest column j (leftmost) and change the color of every cell in R to that chosen reference's color value.\n\n5. Step 5: IF a distinct region R has no recorded top-row reference with column in min_col <= j <= max_col THEN leave every cell of R unchanged.\n\n6. Step 6: IF a pixel is not part of any distinct color-5 region THEN leave its color unchanged.\n",
