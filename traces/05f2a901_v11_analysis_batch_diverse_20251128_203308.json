    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Rigid translation of the color-2 connected object so that it contacts the color-8 2x2 block; input/output dims identical (ratio 1:1).\n\n2. PATTERN: In every example the irregular 2-region is moved (no rotation/flip) to become adjacent/touching the fixed 8 2x2 block; 8 and background remain unchanged.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 2 shifted right by 3 cols to touch 8; 8 unchanged.\n- Ex2: 2 shifted down by 6 rows to touch 8; 8 unchanged.\n- Ex3: 2 shifted up by 3 rows to touch 8; 8 unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Same: every input has one irregular connected region of color 2 and one 2x2 block of color 8; shapes/colors identical.\n- Different: their relative positions and canvas offsets vary; 2 and 8 are initially separated.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: the color-8 2x2 block remains fixed; the color-2 shape and orientation are preserved and end up edge-adjacent (touching) the color-8 block; no other colors change.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: rigid translation of the color-2 object (no rotation/flip/recolor) to the nearest position where it becomes edge-contacting the color-8 2x2 block; color-8 unchanged.\n\n1) Reference objects: the 2x2 color-8 block is the fixed anchor; the irregular color-2 region keeps its shape, color and orientation. The 8-block's position determines the move.\n\n2) Grid pattern: apply a rigid translation of the entire color-2 object toward the color-8 block until they touch (adjacent), with no rotation/flip, no overlap, background unchanged.\n\n3) Objects: key items are the single color-2 connected region (moved) and the color-8 2x2 block (stationary anchor).\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a connected region exists whose color is 8 AND whose bounding box height = 2 AND bounding box width = 2 AND all 4 cells inside that bounding box are color 8 THEN treat that region as the fixed anchor and do not change any color-8 cells.\n\nStep 2: IF there exists exactly one connected region whose color is 2 THEN identify that connected region as the moving object and record its cell coordinates and bounding box (bbox: min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).\n\nStep 3: IF any cell of the moving object (color 2) is orthogonally adjacent (shares an edge, 4-neighbor) to any color-8 cell of the anchor THEN perform no further translations (stop moving the color-2 object).\n\nStep 4: IF moving object bbox min_col < anchor bbox min_col AND the moving object is not orthogonally adjacent to the anchor AND every cell that would be occupied by the moving object after shifting all color-2 cells one unit to the right is color 0 THEN move the entire color-2 object one unit right (copy color 2 to the new positions and set the old positions to color 0), preserving shape and orientation.\n\nStep 5: IF moving object bbox max_col > anchor bbox max_col AND the moving object is not orthogonally adjacent to the anchor AND every cell that would be occupied by the moving object after shifting all color-2 cells one unit to the left is color 0 THEN move the entire color-2 object one unit left (copy color 2 to the new positions and set the old positions to color 0), preserving shape and orientation.\n\nStep 6: IF moving object bbox min_row < anchor bbox min_row AND the moving object is not orthogonally adjacent to the anchor AND every cell that would be occupied by the moving object after shifting all color-2 cells one unit down is color 0 THEN move the entire color-2 object one unit down (copy color 2 to the new positions and set the old positions to color 0), preserving shape and orientation.\n\nStep 7: IF moving object bbox max_row > anchor bbox max_row AND the moving object is not orthogonally adjacent to the anchor AND every cell that would be occupied by the moving object after shifting all color-2 cells one unit up is color 0 THEN move the entire color-2 object one unit up (copy color 2 to the new positions and set the old positions to color 0), preserving shape and orientation.\n\nStep 8: IF a proposed one-unit translation would place any color-2 cell onto a color-8 cell (overlap) THEN do not perform that translation and instead stop (the correct final state is achieved when the moving object becomes orthogonally adjacent to the anchor without overlap).\n",
