    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: grid size unchanged (10x10); distinct connected regions recolored but shapes/positions stay the same.\n\n2) PATTERN: every connected region of color 5 is repainted to the color of the single-pixel marker in row 0 whose column lies inside that region's horizontal span; all other cells unchanged.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: three 5-blocks -> 1 (left), 7 (right), 4 (bottom).\n- Ex2: three 5-blocks -> 6 (center), 2 (left), 8 (bottom-right).\n- Ex3: three 5-blocks -> 1 (left), 7 (right), 6 (center).\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll three have same 10x10 size, many small single-cell colored tiles in row0 and several distinct connected regions of color 5 below. Differences: number/positions of 5-regions vary.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll outputs keep non-5 pixels identical. Only cells originally 5 are recolored. Grid shape/positions unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nRule: each connected region of color 5 is repainted to the color of the single-cell in row 0 whose column falls inside that region's horizontal span (use that top-row color).\n\n- Reference objects: the small single-cell colored tiles in row 0 stay unchanged and serve as color references.\n\n- Grid pattern: entire 10x10 unchanged; every distinct connected orange region (color 5) is recolored to the color of the row-0 reference tile whose column is horizontally nearest/overlaps that object's span.\n\n- Objects: recurring important objects are the connected orange blocks (targets) and the row‑0 singletons (sources).\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a cell's color is not 5 THEN leave that cell's color unchanged.  \n2. Step 2: IF a set of orthogonally connected cells all have color 5 THEN treat that connected set as a single target object (a \"color-5 region\") and compute its horizontal span as min_col = the smallest column index in the region and max_col = the largest column index in the region.  \n3. Step 3: IF a cell is at row 0 AND its color is not 0 AND its four orthogonal neighbors (where defined) are color 0 (i.e., it is a single-pixel marker in row 0) THEN designate that cell as a row-0 color marker whose marker color is the marker cell's color.  \n4. Step 4: IF a color-5 region has horizontal span [min_col,max_col] AND there exists exactly one row-0 color marker at column c with min_col <= c <= max_col THEN change the color of every cell in that color-5 region to the marker color of the row-0 marker at column c.  \n5. Step 5: IF a color-5 region has horizontal span [min_col,max_col] AND there are two or more row-0 color markers at columns c1,c2,... with min_col <= ci <= max_col THEN compute the region's horizontal centroid column (round to nearest integer) and select the marker whose column is nearest that centroid; change the color of every cell in the color-5 region to that selected marker's color.  \n6. Step 6: IF a cell is a row-0 color marker (as defined in Step 3) THEN leave that marker cell's color unchanged.\n",
