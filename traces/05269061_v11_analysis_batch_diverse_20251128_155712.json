    "raw_analysis": "1) Transformation: size preserved (7x7→7x7), ratio 1:1; fills whole grid.  \n\n2) Pattern: extract the three-color stepped diagonal from input and tile a 3-color cyclic checkerboard across the entire output (rows are cyclic shifts). This rule applies to all examples.  \n\n3) Key changes:\n- Ex1: diagonal colors {1,2,4} → output tiles cycle [2,4,1].\n- Ex2: diagonal {2,8,3} → output tiles cycle [2,8,3].\n- Ex3: diagonal {8,3,4} → output tiles cycle [4,8,3].\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll inputs share a black background (0) and a distinct 3-color stepped diagonal of three nonzero colors. They differ in diagonal location/orientation and in the actual color sets: ex1 {1,2,4}, ex2 {2,8,3}, ex3 {4,8,3}.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll outputs are 7x7, fully filled (no 0), forming a 3-color cyclic checkerboard that repeats every 3 cells in rows and columns.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nExtract the three diagonal colors in input order and tile them so cell(r,c)=sequence[(r+c) mod 3]. This rule fits all examples.\n\n1) Reference objects: the three-color stepped diagonal (the ordered triple and their relative offsets). Its colors and sequence never change and set the palette/order for the output.\n\n2) Grid pattern: tile a 3-cycle checkerboard: fill whole 7x7 by repeating the 3-color sequence so cell color = sequence[(row+col) mod 3], preserving the diagonal order/orientation. Size stays 7x7.\n\n3) Objects: the three colored pixels (their order) are critical; background is ignored and replaced by the tiled pattern.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input grid is 7x7 THEN identify all cells whose color is not 0 (treat color 0 as background) and continue only with those nonzero cells.\n\n2. Step 2: IF there exists a connected chain of nonzero cells such that each consecutive cell in the chain is exactly one step down (row+1, same col) OR one step right (same row, col+1) from the previous cell (i.e., a stepped/staircase diagonal) THEN locate every such chain and keep only chains that contain at least three distinct nonzero colors.\n\n3. Step 3: IF one or more chains contain at least three distinct nonzero colors THEN select the chain to use as the reference chain by choosing the chain that contains three distinct colors; if multiple chains qualify choose the chain whose first cell has the smallest (row+col) (the top-leftmost endpoint).\n\n4. Step 4: IF a reference chain is selected THEN order its cells by increasing (row+col) (top-left endpoint first, bottom-right endpoint last) and form the ordered triple S = [color of first cell, color of second cell, color of third cell] (if the chain is longer than 3, the pattern repeats so take the first three in order).\n\n5. Step 5: IF S = [s0,s1,s2] and the reference chain's top-leftmost cell has coordinates (r_ref,c_ref) and color color_ref THEN compute a cyclic shift T of S (rotate S by 0,1 or 2 positions) such that T[(r_ref + c_ref) mod 3] = color_ref (i.e., choose the shift so the top-leftmost chain cell's color matches T at index (r_ref+c_ref) mod 3).\n\n6. Step 6: IF T (a 3-element cyclic sequence of color numbers) is determined THEN fill every cell (r,c) of the 7x7 output grid with color T[(r + c) mod 3] (atomic action: set color of cell (r,c) to that value), replacing any 0 background so the entire grid is filled with the 3-color repeating checkerboard.\n",
