    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Uniform upscale by factor 3 (3x3 -> 9x9); each input cell becomes a 3x3 block (area ×9).  \n2. PATTERN: For every input cell: if color !=0, copy the entire 3x3 input pattern into the corresponding 3x3 output block (preserving colors); if 0, that block is all 0.  \n3. KEY CHANGES:  \n- Ex1: nonzero 6 cells become blocks containing the input pattern (6 and 0 preserved); input 0 cells become zero blocks.  \n- Ex2: 4 at (0,0),(0,2),(2,1) yield blocks equal to full input pattern; others zero.  \n- Ex3: 2 at (1,2),(2,0),(2,2) produce blocks equal to input pattern; others zero.  \n- Ex4: 2s produce blocks copying the input 3x3 pattern (rows/cols of 2 preserved); zeros yield zero blocks.  \n- Ex5: 7s produce blocks that replicate the input pattern (7 and 0 preserved); zero cells give zero blocks.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll inputs are 3x3 with background 0. Each contains a single nonzero color (6,4,2,2,7) in different layouts. Size and single-color property are constant; patterns differ.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll outputs are 9x9 composed of nine 3x3 blocks. Exactly the same: every 3x3 block equals the original 3x3 input pattern (zeros stay 0); positions of nonzero blocks mirror input nonzero cells.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nRule: upscale by 3. For each input cell value c: if c=0 place a 3x3 zero block; if c≠0 place the entire 3x3 input pattern into that block, recoloring its nonzero cells to c.\n\nReference objects: the 3x3 input pattern P (its nonzero pixels and their color) is preserved and reused. Nonzero cells act as anchors.\n\nGrid pattern: output is 9x9 created by stamping P at (row=i*3, col=j*3) for every input cell (i,j) that is nonzero — i.e. each nonzero seeds a full copy of P.\n\nObjects: the crucial objects are the nonzero pixels (anchors) and the whole P; repeated copies of P at block-aligned positions form the output.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input grid is a 3x3 array THEN create an output grid that is 9x9 and initialize every cell of the 9x9 output to color 0.  \n2. Step 2: IF the input grid is 3x3 THEN define pattern P as the entire 3x3 input pattern P[r,c] = input[r,c] for r,c in {0,1,2} (use 0-indexed rows and columns).  \n3. Step 3: IF a specific input cell at row i, col j (i,j in {0,1,2}) has color c where c != 0 THEN copy pattern P into the 9x9 output so that for every r,c in {0,1,2} the output cell at row (3*i + r), col (3*j + c) is set to P[r,c].  \n4. Step 4: IF a specific input cell at row i, col j (i,j in {0,1,2}) has color 0 THEN set all nine cells in the corresponding 3x3 output block with top-left at (3*i,3*j) to color 0.  \n5. Step 5: IF copying any pixel value from P into the output block THEN preserve the pixel color exactly (do not change numeric color values during the copy).  \n6. Step 6: IF no input cell triggers a copy for a given 3x3 output block (i.e., input cell was 0) THEN leave that entire 3x3 block as the initialized color 0 (no other modification).\n",
