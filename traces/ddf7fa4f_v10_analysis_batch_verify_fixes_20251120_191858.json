    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION: Input and output are 10x10 (unchanged). Each distinct connected region of color 5 is recolored to a top-row single-pixel color above it.\n\n2) PATTERN: For every connected 5-object, find its column span (or topmost cell column); take the nonzero color in row0 at that column and replace the entire 5-region with that color. All other cells stay same.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 5-regions → left:5→1, right:5→7, bottom:5→4; rest unchanged.\n- Ex2: 5-regions → left:5→2, middle:5→6, bottom-right:5→8; rest unchanged.\n- Ex3: 5-regions → left:5→1, middle:5→6, right:5→7; rest unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs are 10x10. Row0 contains three single-pixel nonzero markers. Each input has three distinct connected regions of color 5 at separate horizontal positions.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All outputs leave non-5 cells unchanged. Every 5-object is recolored uniformly (no shape change). The new color equals a row0 marker.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: For each connected region of color 5, recolor every cell of that object to the color c found in row0 at some column within the object's horizontal span (min_col..max_col).\n\nREFERENCE OBJECTS: Top-row single‑pixel colored markers (unchanged) and each distinct connected region of color 5 (shape/position preserved). The markers serve as color keys.\n\nGRID PATTERNS: For every color‑5 object, identify its horizontal span and find the nonzero pixel in row0 whose column falls inside that span; recolor the entire object to that top‑row pixel's color. All other cells unchanged.\n\nOBJECTS: Most important: the three single‑pixel top markers and each connected color‑5 region (they map one‑to‑one).\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a cell is in row 0 AND its color is nonzero THEN do not change that cell's color.  \nStep 2: IF a cell's color is not 5 THEN do not change that cell's color.  \nStep 3: IF there exists a connected region (connected by orthogonal adjacency) of cells whose color is 5 THEN treat that connected region as one object and compute its horizontal span [min_col, max_col] (the minimum and maximum column indices occupied by that object).  \nStep 4: IF there exists one or more nonzero pixels in row 0 at columns C such that min_col <= C <= max_col THEN select the target column C* equal to the leftmost such column C (the smallest C that satisfies the inequality).  \nStep 5: IF a target column C* has been selected for a given connected 5-region THEN set target_color = the color of the pixel at position (row=0, col=C*) (i.e., color at (0,C*)).  \nStep 6: IF target_color is defined for that connected 5-region THEN change the color of every cell in that connected 5-region (every cell whose color was 5 and belongs to that object) to target_color.  \nStep 7: IF a connected 5-region has no nonzero pixel in row 0 with column in its horizontal span [min_col, max_col] THEN leave that 5-region unchanged.\n",
