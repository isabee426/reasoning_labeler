    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Same size (11x11), 1:1 ratio; the orange cross (5) stays and the nine 3x3 cells around it are replaced by uniform-color 3x3 blocks. \n\n2) PATTERN: For each of the nine subcells (3x3 blocks separated by the orange cross) pick the dominant/non-black color in that input subcell and fill the entire subcell in the output with that color; 5 and 0 remain at their positions.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: TL=0, TC=3, TR=0; ML=0, MC=6, MR=4; BL=2, BC=0, BR=0; 5 unchanged.\n- Ex2: TL=0, TC=0, TR=2; ML=0, MC=3, MR=0; BL=4, BC=0, BR=6; 5 unchanged.\n- Ex3: TL=0, TC=4, TR=0; ML=0, MC=2, MR=6; BL=0, BC=3, BR=0; 5 unchanged.\n- Ex4: TL=2, TC=0, TR=0; ML=0, MC=4, MR=3; BL=6, BC=0, BR=0; 5 unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Differences: the colors inside each 3x3 cell vary across examples.\n- Same: 11x11 grid, a fixed orange cross (color 5) at row/col indices forming separators, and the 3x3 subcell layout is identical.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly the same: the orange cross (5) remains unchanged in all outputs; every 3x3 region is filled with a single uniform color; block positions unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule that fits all: each 3x3 input subcell is replaced by a solid 3x3 block whose color is taken from that subcell (a single color present in that 3x3). Multiple equivalent sampling rules (e.g. pick a specific cell in the 3x3 or the modal color excluding 5) explain the examples.\n\n- Reference objects: The orange cross (color 5) is invariant and partitions the 11x11 into nine 3x3 cells. It anchors positions and alignment for the transform.\n\n- Grid pattern: For every example, each of the nine 3x3 regions (cells) outside the cross is replaced by a uniform 3x3 block whose color equals the dominant color found in that region in the input.\n\n- Objects: Key objects = the fixed orange cross and the nine surrounding 3x3 tiles; tiles are independently collapsed to a single color (their regional majority).\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a cell's color is 5 THEN leave that cell unchanged (do not modify any cell whose color is 5).\n\nStep 2: IF a 3x3 contiguous region is bounded by the orange cross (i.e., it is one of the nine 3x3 blocks formed by the rows and columns of color 5 -- rows 0-2, 4-6, 8-10 combined with cols 0-2, 4-6, 8-10) THEN treat that region as a single tile to be uniformly recolored.\n\nStep 3: IF a 3x3 tile (as defined in Step 2) contains at least one cell whose color is not 0 THEN determine the frequency of each non-zero color in that 3x3 tile and pick the non-zero color with the highest frequency, THEN change all 9 cells of that 3x3 tile to that chosen non-zero color.\n\nStep 4: IF in a 3x3 tile there is a tie for the highest frequency among two or more non-zero colors THEN choose the tied color whose earliest occurrence in reading order (lowest row index inside the tile; if equal row then lowest column index) appears first, THEN change all 9 cells of that 3x3 tile to that chosen tied color.\n\nStep 5: IF a 3x3 tile contains only color 0 (every cell in that tile is 0) THEN leave that tile as all 0s (or equivalently, set all 9 cells of that tile to color 0).\n",
