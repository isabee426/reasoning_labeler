    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Input and output sizes identical (10x10, ratio 1:1); objects are recolored but not moved.\n\n2. PATTERN: Every distinct connected region of color 5 is replaced by a top-row singleton color; assignment is by left-to-right horizontal order (leftmost 5-region → leftmost top singleton, etc.). All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: three color-5 regions → left 5→1, right 5→7, bottom 5→4; other colors unchanged.\n- Ex2: three 5-regions → left 5→2, center 5→6, right/bottom 5→8; others unchanged.\n- Ex3: three 5-regions → left 5→1, center 5→6, right 5→7; others unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs are 10x10, each contains three distinct connected regions of color 5 with different horizontal spans. Row0 contains three single colored pixels (ex1: {1,4,7}, ex2: {2,6,8}, ex3: {1,6,7}). Other colors/background locations are the same relative layout.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- In every output the non-5 pixels (including row0) are unchanged. Each connected 5-region is recolored uniformly to a nonzero color.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: for each connected region of color 5, recolor that region to the color of the nonzero pixel in row0 whose column lies inside the region's horizontal span (use that top-row color number). Sizes and other colors stay the same.\n\n1) REFERENCE OBJECTS: The three single colored pixels in row 0 stay unchanged and serve as color references.\n\n2) GRID PATTERN: For every distinct orange connected region, recolor it with the color of the row‑0 pixel whose column lies within that region's horizontal span (i.e., the top reference above/overlapping the region).\n\n3) OBJECTS: The key objects are the three connected orange regions (distinct blobs). They are recolored in place; positions/shape remain.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a group of pixels is a connected region whose color is 5 (treat connectivity as the region of adjacent pixels forming one blob) THEN mark that connected region as a target object to be recolored.\n\nStep 2: IF a target object has a horizontal span from column A (the object's minimum column index) to column B (the object's maximum column index) THEN search row 0 for any pixel(s) at column c satisfying A <= c <= B whose color is not 0.\n\nStep 3: IF exactly one row-0 pixel is found in that span and its color is N (N is one of 1..9) THEN change the color of every pixel in the entire connected region (all pixels that were color 5 in that object) to color N.\n\nStep 4: IF more than one row-0 nonzero pixel is found whose column c satisfies A <= c <= B THEN select the row-0 pixel with the smallest column index (leftmost) and change the color of every pixel in the entire connected region (all original color-5 pixels) to that selected pixel's color N.\n\nStep 5: IF no row-0 nonzero pixel exists with column c satisfying A <= c <= B for a given target object THEN leave every pixel of that connected region unchanged (keep color 5).\n\nStep 6: IF a pixel is not part of any connected region of color 5 (including pixels in row 0) THEN leave that pixel's color unchanged (do not move or recolor any non-5 pixels).\n",
