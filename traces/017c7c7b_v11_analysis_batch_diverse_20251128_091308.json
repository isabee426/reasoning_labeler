Color 1 → 2, 0 stays 0.\n\n2) PATTERN: Take the input, map 1→2, and extend the vertical polyline by appending a 3‑row block that continues the existing 3‑row motif, yielding 9 rows (the colored snake is repeated/extended).\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 1→2; append rows 0–2 (recolored).\n- Ex2: 1→2; append rows 2–4 (recolored).\n- Ex3: 1→2; append rows 0–2 (recolored).\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Differences: horizontal protrusions and exact row pattern vary (which rows have 1s).\n- Same: all inputs are 6x3, use colors 0 and 1, and contain a single connected vertical polyline of 1s.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: all outputs are 9x3, palette {0,2}, zeros remain 0, ones become 2, top 6 rows = input with 1->2.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Transformations that hold for ALL examples:\n  1) Color map: 1 -> 2; 0 unchanged.\n  2) Height: 6 -> 9 by appending a 3-row block that continues/extends the vertical polyline (so the output’s last three rows extend the input stroke).\n\nReference objects: the single connected vertical shape of 1s (with its left/right horizontal protrusions). Its column positions and local row patterns stay fixed and guide where to extend.\n\nGrid pattern: map 1->2, 0 stays 0, keep width. Scale height by 1.5 by vertically tiling/repeating the object's row-sequence until new height reached (append rows from the object's pattern).\n\nObjects: the main connected region of 1s is the only important object; preserve its horizontal protrusions and repeat its row pattern to extend vertically.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input grid has height = 6 and width = 3 THEN create an output grid of height = 9 and width = 3 initialized with color 0 in every cell.  \n2. Step 2: IF a cell in the input grid (row r, column c) has color 1 THEN set the cell at the same coordinates (row r, column c) in the output grid to color 2.  \n3. Step 3: IF a cell in the input grid (row r, column c) has color 0 THEN set the cell at the same coordinates (row r, column c) in the output grid to color 0 (leave unchanged).  \n4. Step 4: IF the input contains exactly one connected object made of color 1 (a single vertical polyline) THEN locate a contiguous 3-row segment of that object that represents one full local motif of the polyline’s horizontal-protrusion pattern (i.e., three consecutive input rows that together show the left/center/right protrusion arrangement that recurs along the snake).  \n5. Step 5: IF the 3-row motif from Step 4 is identified THEN copy that 3-row block (preserving each column position) and place it into the output grid as rows 6,7,8 (directly below the original rows 0–5), mapping color 1 -> color 2 when copying.  \n6. Step 6: IF more than one 3-row motif candidate exists THEN choose the candidate whose top row has a 1 in the center column aligned vertically with the object’s bottommost 1 so that the appended block remains connected to the original object; then perform the copy in Step 5.  \n7. Step 7: IF any cell in the output grid was not set by Steps 2–6 THEN leave that cell as color 0.\n",
