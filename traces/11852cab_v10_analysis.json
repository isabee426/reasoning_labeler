    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Input and output are both 10x10 (ratio 1:1); grid size unchanged.\n\n2) PATTERN: Complete peripheral symmetry: any asymmetric colored cell in the 3x3 surrounding ring is copied into the other three positions symmetric about the ring's center, producing fourfold symmetry; central cell and ring colors remain.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: color 2 duplicated to the three missing corner positions; colors 3 and 4 unchanged.\n- Ex2: color 3 duplicated to complete four corners; colors 2 and 8 unchanged.\n- Ex3: color 4 duplicated to complete the ring symmetry; color 1 (center) and 8s unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nEach input has a central core and an 8-cell ring around it. Inputs differ in WHICH ring cells are colored and in color values, but the ring location and core remain the same.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll outputs have the full 8-cell ring filled. The ring is 4-fold rotationally symmetric about the same center. The central/core cells are unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nRule: for every colored cell on the 8-cell ring, copy its color into the three positions obtained by 90° rotations about the center, preserving colors (e.g. 2,3,8,4,1).\n\nREFERENCE OBJECTS: The invariant is the central core (the center cell(s)); it stays unchanged and defines the ring's center.\n\nGRID PATTERN: Complete the 8‑cell peripheral ring by copying each existing ring cell to its symmetric counterparts around the core (mirror/rotate to fill the other quadrant positions). Grid size and core unchanged.\n\nOBJECTS: Key objects = central core + surrounding 8‑cell ring. Ring cells' colors are preserved and replicated to achieve fourfold/peripheral symmetry; background untouched.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF there exists a 3x3 block whose center cell has color != 0 AND at least one of the 8 surrounding cells in that 3x3 block has color != 0 THEN designate that center cell as the ring center (call its coordinates (r,c)).\n\nStep 2: IF a cell is in the 8-cell ring immediately surrounding the ring center (i.e., at one of the relative offsets (−1,−1),(−1,0),(−1,+1),(0,+1),(+1,+1),(+1,0),(+1,−1),(0,−1) from (r,c)) AND its color is C where C != 0 THEN for each of the three other positions obtained by rotating that relative offset 90°,180° and 270° about the center (r,c) IF the target cell's current color is 0 THEN set the target cell's color to C.\n\nStep 3: IF a target ring cell (one of the 8 positions around (r,c)) already has color != 0 THEN do not change that target cell's color (do not overwrite nonzero colors).\n\nStep 4: IF a cell is the center cell (r,c) of the identified 3x3 block THEN do not change its color (leave it exactly as in the input).\n\nStep 5: IF a cell is not inside the 3x3 block centered at (r,c) (i.e., not the center and not one of the 8 surrounding positions) THEN leave that cell unchanged.\n\nStep 6: IF multiple distinct 3x3 candidate centers exist (multiple nonzero centers with surrounding nonzero ring cells) THEN apply Steps 2–5 independently for each such center.\n",
