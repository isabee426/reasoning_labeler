    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION: uniform upscale by factor 3 (3x3 -> 9x9); ratio 3 in both dims, consistent.\n\n2) PATTERN: output is a 3x3 tiling of macroblocks (one per input cell). Each nonzero input cell (color C) is replaced by the same 3x3 motif: the binary complement of the entire input mask, drawn in color C; input-0 cells become all-0 macroblocks.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\nEx1: input 6s -> each becomes a 3x3 block showing complement-of-input in color 6; zeros remain 0.\nEx2: input 7s -> each becomes 3x3 corner-7 motif (complement) in color 7; zeros remain 0.\nEx3: input 4s -> each becomes 3x3 complement motif in color 4; zeros remain 0.\n\nStage 1 summary per example: puzzle type = block-replacement/upscale; visual = small mask inverted to form each filled macroblock; grid = 3x3 macroblocks mapping input positions to identical motif colored by that cell.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs are 3x3 with background 0 and a single nonzero color (6,7,4).  \n- Patterns differ: diagonal (6), cross (7), L-shape (4).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All outputs are 9x9 composed of a 3x3 grid of 3x3 macroblocks.  \n- Macroblocks for input 0 are all zeros. Every nonzero cell produces the same 3x3 motif colored by that cell (color preserved).\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: upscale by factor 3 (tile 3x3). For each input cell: if 0 -> 3x3 zero block; if C -> place a fixed 3x3 pattern filled with color C in that macroblock.\n\nReference objects: the single-color 3x3 motif in the input is the template and its color is preserved.  \nGrid pattern: the whole image is uniformly upscaled by factor 3 and arranged as a 3x3 tiling of macroblocks.  \nTransformation: each input cell -> one 3x3 tile: 0 -> empty tile; nonzero -> tile filled with a copy (same color) of the template (orientation consistent per tile).  \nObjects: the single-color connected motif drives the mapping.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input grid is a 3x3 block THEN create an output grid of size 9x9 initialized entirely to color 0.  \n2. Step 2: IF an input cell at coordinates (r,c) has color 0 THEN fill the 3x3 tile in the output at rows [3*r .. 3*r+2] and columns [3*c .. 3*c+2] with color 0.  \n3. Step 3: IF there exists any input cell whose color is C where C != 0 THEN compute a 3x3 binary complement mask M of the entire input defined by: for each input coordinate (i,j), M(i,j)=1 IF input(i,j)=0, otherwise M(i,j)=0.  \n4. Step 4: IF an input cell at (r,c) has color C where C != 0 AND M(i,j)=1 at position (i,j) of the complement mask THEN set output pixel (3*r + i, 3*c + j) to color C.  \n5. Step 5: IF an input cell at (r,c) has color C where C != 0 AND M(i,j)=0 at position (i,j) of the complement mask THEN set output pixel (3*r + i, 3*c + j) to color 0.  \n6. Step 6: IF multiple input cells are nonzero (colors may be identical or different) THEN apply Steps 4-5 independently for each nonzero input cell so each input cell produces its own 3x3 tile in the output at the tile position corresponding to its (r,c).  \n7. Step 7: IF an input cell's color is C (C != 0) THEN preserve that numeric color C when painting its 3x3 tile (do not change or mix C with other colors).\n",
