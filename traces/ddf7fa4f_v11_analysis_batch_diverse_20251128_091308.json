    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Input and output are both 10x10 (unchanged).\n\n2) PATTERN: Every connected region of color 5 is recolored to the color of the single-cell pixel in row 0 whose column lies within that region's horizontal span; all other cells keep their colors.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 5→1 (left), 5→4 (middle-bottom), 5→7 (right); others same.\n- Ex2: 5→2 (left), 5→6 (top-center), 5→8 (bottom-right); others same.\n- Ex3: 5→1 (left), 5→6 (center), 5→7 (right); others same.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll inputs have multiple connected regions of color 5 and three single-cell colored markers in row 0 (distinct columns). Background (0) and other non-5 objects keep their positions; the 5-regions vary in shape and column span.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nRow 0 is identical in all outputs. Non-5 pixels unchanged. Each original 5-region keeps shape/position but is recolored.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nEvery connected region of 5 is recolored to the color of the single-cell pixel in row 0 whose column lies within that region's horizontal span (use that marker color).\n\n- Reference objects: the three single‑cell colored markers in row 0 and overall 10x10 grid remain unchanged; they provide the target colors.\n- Grid pattern: for every connected region of color 5, recolor that entire region to the color of the row‑0 marker whose column lies inside that region’s horizontal span.\n- Key objects: distinct connected 5‑regions (targets) and the three top‑row single‑pixel markers (color sources).\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF a cell is in row 0 AND its color is not 0 AND it has no orthogonally adjacent cell of the same color (i.e., it is a single-cell pixel in row 0) THEN mark that cell as a color-source and record its column index and color C (where C is one of 1-9).\n\n2. Step 2: IF a set of cells forms a connected region (orthogonal adjacency) AND every cell in that region has color 5 THEN identify that set as a connected region-of-5 and determine its horizontal span [min_col, max_col] where min_col and max_col are the smallest and largest column indices of cells in the region.\n\n3. Step 3: IF a connected region-of-5 has a horizontal span [min_col, max_col] that includes (i.e., min_col <= col <= max_col) the column index col of a previously recorded row-0 color-source whose color is C THEN change the color of every cell in that connected region-of-5 to color C.\n\n4. Step 4: IF a connected region-of-5 has a horizontal span that includes more than one recorded row-0 color-source column THEN (apply Step 3 using the color-source whose column lies within the span and, if multiple exist, choose the one whose column is between min_col and max_col and is unique in the training pattern; otherwise use the leftmost such color-source) — change every cell in that region to that chosen color C.\n\n5. Step 5: IF a cell is not color 5 (including row-0 color-source cells and all other colors such as 0, orange objects, etc.) THEN leave that cell’s color unchanged.\n\n6. Step 6: IF no row-0 color-source column lies inside a connected region-of-5’s horizontal span (this does not occur in the training set) THEN leave that region-of-5 unchanged (retain color 5).\n",
