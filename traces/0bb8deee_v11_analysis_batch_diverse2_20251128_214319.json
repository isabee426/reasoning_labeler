    "raw_analysis": "1) Transformation: Extract the four quadrant objects and pack them into a 6x6 made of four 3x3 tiles; output always 6x6 (input->output ratio varies). \n\n2) Pattern: Remove the thick central cross, locate the single connected colored object in each quadrant, crop each to its 3x3 bounding box (keep color & shape), place into corresponding quadrant of a 2x2 3x3 output.\n\n3) Key changes:\n- EX1: extracted 2(TL), 3(TR), 5(BL), 8(BR); shapes/colors preserved; cross (1) removed.\n- EX2: extracted 1(TL), 3(TR), 4(BL), 5(BR); shapes/colors preserved; cross (2) removed.\n- EX3: extracted 2(TL), 1(TR), 4(BL), 5(BR); shapes/colors preserved; cross (3) removed.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs have a thick + cross of one color (varies: 1,2,3) dividing the canvas into four quadrants. Each quadrant contains a single distinct connected object (colors differ per quadrant: e.g. 2,3,5,8 etc). Object shapes and colors vary but are fully contained in one quadrant.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Every output is exactly 6x6, composed of four 3x3 tiles (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Each tile contains one quadrant's object with the same color and shape; background cells are 0.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Remove the central cross. For each quadrant, extract its connected colored object (preserve color, shape, orientation) and place it into the corresponding 3x3 tile of a 6x6 output (empty cells -> 0).\n\nReference objects: the thick centered + (color varies) is constant; it partitions the canvas and is used as the reference to locate four quadrant objects (the cross itself is omitted from output).\n\nGrid pattern: for all cases extract the single connected colored blob in each quadrant, fit/trim it into a 3x3 tile preserving color and orientation, then assemble the four 3x3 tiles into a 2x2 block -> a 6x6 output (TL, TR, BL, BR).\n\nObjects: the four quadrant connected shapes (distinct colors) are the important recurring motifs; their shape, color and quadrant determine each 3x3 tile.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF there exists a vertical connected line of a single nonzero color that spans from the top to the bottom of the canvas AND a horizontal connected line of that same color that spans from the left to the right and they intersect, THEN designate that color as cross_color and remove (ignore) every pixel of color cross_color for the remainder of the procedure.\n\n2. Step 2: IF a connected nonzero-color region (connected component) remains entirely inside the top-left quadrant (i.e., strictly above the horizontal cross and strictly left of the vertical cross) AND its color is not cross_color, THEN compute its minimal bounding box and extract that region preserving exact pixel colors and relative positions; if the bounding box is smaller than 3x3, pad with color 0 to make it exactly a 3x3 block without rotating or reflecting.\n\n3. Step 3: IF a connected nonzero-color region remains entirely inside the top-right quadrant (i.e., strictly above the horizontal cross and strictly right of the vertical cross) AND its color is not cross_color, THEN compute its minimal bounding box and extract that region preserving exact pixel colors and relative positions; if the bounding box is smaller than 3x3, pad with color 0 to make it exactly a 3x3 block without rotating or reflecting.\n\n4. Step 4: IF a connected nonzero-color region remains entirely inside the bottom-left quadrant (i.e., strictly below the horizontal cross and strictly left of the vertical cross) AND its color is not cross_color, THEN compute its minimal bounding box and extract that region preserving exact pixel colors and relative positions; if the bounding box is smaller than 3x3, pad with color 0 to make it exactly a 3x3 block without rotating or reflecting.\n\n5. Step 5: IF a connected nonzero-color region remains entirely inside the bottom-right quadrant (i.e., strictly below the horizontal cross and strictly right of the vertical cross) AND its color is not cross_color, THEN compute its minimal bounding box and extract that region preserving exact pixel colors and relative positions; if the bounding box is smaller than 3x3, pad with color 0 to make it exactly a 3x3 block without rotating or reflecting.\n\n6. Step 6: IF a 3x3 block has been produced for the object from the top-left quadrant, THEN place that 3x3 block into rows 0-2 and columns 0-2 of the output grid (top-left tile) preserving the block's pixel colors.\n\n7. Step 7: IF a 3x3 block has been produced for the object from the top-right quadrant, THEN place that 3x3 block into rows 0-2 and columns 3-5 of the output grid (top-right tile) preserving the block's pixel colors.\n\n8. Step 8: IF a 3x3 block has been produced for the object from the bottom-left quadrant, THEN place that 3x3 block into rows 3-5 and columns 0-2 of the output grid (bottom-left tile) preserving the block's pixel colors.\n\n9. Step 9: IF a 3x3 block has been produced for the object from the bottom-right quadrant, THEN place that 3x3 block into rows 3-5 and columns 3-5 of the output grid (bottom-right tile) preserving the block's pixel colors.\n\n10. Step 10: IF any quadrant contains no connected non-cross object, THEN fill the corresponding 3x3 tile in the output with color 0; after all four tiles are placed, output exactly a 6x6 grid composed of the four 3x3 tiles (the cross_color is omitted).\n",
