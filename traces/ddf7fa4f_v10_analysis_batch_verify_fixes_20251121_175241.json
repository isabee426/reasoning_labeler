    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Grid size stays 10x10 (1:1); connected shapes preserved but recolored.\n\n2. PATTERN: Every connected region of color 5 is recolored to the color of the single-pixel in row 0 whose column overlaps that region's horizontal span; all other pixels unchanged.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\nEx1: 5->1 (left), 5->7 (right), 5->4 (bottom).\nEx2: 5->2 (left), 5->6 (center), 5->8 (right).\nEx3: 5->1 (left), 5->6 (center), 5->7 (right).\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nSame: all are 10x10, background 0, contain several connected regions of color 5 and three distinct single nonzero pixels in row 0. Differ: positions, shapes and horizontal spans of the 5-regions and the columns/colors of the row-0 pixels.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nExactly same: non-5 pixels unchanged (row0 unchanged); each original 5-region keeps its shape/location but is uniformly recolored; recolor uses one of the row-0 colors.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nRule: For each connected region of color 5, find its column span; recolor that entire region to the color of the single nonzero pixel in row 0 whose column lies inside that span.\n\nReference objects: the single colored pixels in row 0 remain unchanged and act as anchors/palette. They guide mapping by horizontal position.\n\nGrid pattern: For every connected region of color 5, recolor the entire region to the color of the top-row singleton whose column lies within (or nearest to) that region’s horizontal span.\n\nObjects: The recurring, critical objects are the distinct connected 5-regions (each mapped separately). Grid size/background and other singletons stay fixed.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a pixel is at row 0 AND its color is not 0 AND it has no orthogonally adjacent pixel of the same color (i.e., it is a single nonzero pixel in row 0) THEN treat that pixel as a palette anchor and record its column index and its color.\n\nStep 2: IF a set of orthogonally connected pixels all have color 5 THEN identify that connected set as one distinct region-of-5 and determine its horizontal span by computing the minimum column index (min_col) and maximum column index (max_col) of pixels in that region.\n\nStep 3: IF a region-of-5 has at least one palette anchor whose column c satisfies min_col ≤ c ≤ max_col THEN change the color of every pixel in that region-of-5 to the color of the palette anchor at column c.\n\nStep 4: IF a region-of-5 has more than one palette anchor with columns inside its span (more than one c with min_col ≤ c ≤ max_col) THEN compute the region's horizontal center as (min_col + max_col)/2 and choose the palette anchor whose column is nearest to that horizontal center; change the color of every pixel in the region-of-5 to that chosen anchor's color.\n\nStep 5: IF a region-of-5 has no palette anchor column that lies inside its span (no c with min_col ≤ c ≤ max_col) THEN choose the palette anchor whose column has the smallest absolute horizontal distance to the region's horizontal center (minimize |c - (min_col+max_col)/2|) and change the color of every pixel in the region-of-5 to that chosen anchor's color.\n\nStep 6: IF a pixel's color is not 5 THEN leave that pixel unchanged (do not move or recolor it).\n",
