Row 0 has three single-pixel markers (different colors). Each input has multiple distinct connected regions of color 5. Marker positions, marker colors and 5-region shapes/locations vary.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- In every output row0 and all non-5 pixels are unchanged. Each 5-region retains shape/location but is recolored.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: Recolor each connected region of 5 to the color of the row-0 single-pixel whose column falls inside that region's horizontal span.\n\nReference objects: the three single‑pixel colored markers in row 0 stay identical and act as color anchors.  \nGrid pattern: every connected region of color 5 is recolored to the color of the row‑0 marker whose column is closest to that object's horizontal centroid (or overlap).  \nObjects: the recurring, crucial objects are the distinct color‑5 regions (typically three); their shapes/positions stay the same, only their color changes.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a pixel is in row 0 AND its color is not 0 THEN mark that pixel as a column marker and record its column index and its color (a value 0–9).  \nStep 2: IF a pixel has color 5 THEN identify the full connected region of color 5 using orthogonal (4-connected) adjacency and compute that region's horizontal span [min_col, max_col] (the minimum and maximum column indices of pixels in the region).  \nStep 3: IF a connected region of color 5 has at least one recorded column marker whose column c satisfies min_col <= c <= max_col THEN change the color of every pixel in that connected region to the color of the recorded marker at column c.  \nStep 4: IF a connected region of color 5 has more than one recorded column marker with columns inside its span (multiple c satisfying min_col <= c <= max_col) THEN compute the region horizontal centroid (average of min_col and max_col) and change the color of every pixel in the region to the color of the marker whose column is closest to that centroid.  \nStep 5: IF a connected region of color 5 has no recorded column marker with column inside its span THEN find the recorded column marker whose column has the minimum absolute horizontal distance to the region centroid (or to the nearest column in the span) and change the color of every pixel in the region to that marker's color.  \nStep 6: IF a pixel is not part of any connected region of color 5 (i.e., its color is not 5) THEN leave that pixel's color unchanged.\n",
