    "raw_analysis": "1) Transformation: The grid is split by the horizontal cyan row into two 6x4 blocks; the lower block's shape is moved into the output area (rows 0-5), recolored to 8, cyan and original colors removed (size always 6x4). Ratio: rows shrink 13->6 (keep 4 cols).\n\n2) Pattern: For all examples the lower region beneath the cyan stripe (color 6 region) is extracted, recolored to 8, placed in the 6x4 output; all other colors removed.\n\n3) Key changes:\n- Ex1: color6 region extracted, recolored->8; 2 and 7 removed.\n- Ex2: color6 block ->8; 2 and 7 removed.\n- Ex3: color6 block ->8; 2 and 7 removed.\n- Ex4: color6 block ->8; 2 and 7 removed.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\nAll inputs have a full-width separator row of color 7 dividing two 6x4 blocks. The upper block always contains a color-2 connected shape; the lower block always contains a color-6 connected shape. The exact shape and placement vary per example.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nEvery output is 6x4 and uses only colors 0 and 8. The 8 pixels form a single connected region (one shape) in each output.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\nIn every case the color-6 shape from the lower block is taken, recolored to 8, and placed into the 6x4 output (other colors removed).\n\n1) Reference objects: The full-width cyan separator row (color 7) is invariant and marks a split. The two large colored connected components above (color 2) and below (color 6) are stable reference objects; the lower component is the source shape.\n\n2) Grid pattern for all: Extract the distinct connected object in the lower 6x4 block, recolor it to color 8, and place it into the upper 6x4 region (same column positions, moved up across the separator) on a cleared background.\n\n3) Objects: The most important are the largest connected components in each half. Recurring pattern: copy the lower-half object, keep its shape, recolor to 8, and transplant it into the top block.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF there exists a row in which every cell's color is 7 THEN designate that row as the full-width separator, define the \"upper block\" as the 6 rows immediately above that row and the \"lower block\" as the 6 rows immediately below that row.  \n2. Step 2: IF any cell in the lower block has color 6 THEN identify the distinct connected component(s) within the lower block composed of cells whose color is 6 (orthogonal adjacency).  \n3. Step 3: IF a connected component of color 6 has been identified in the lower block THEN create a copy of that component and change the color of every cell in the copy from 6 to 8 (atomic action: change color to 8).  \n4. Step 4: IF the upper block exists (rows above the separator) THEN set every cell in the upper block to color 0 (atomic action: change color to 0) to clear the target placement area before placing the copied object.  \n5. Step 5: IF the recolored copy (color 8) exists THEN place (copy) each cell of that recolored copy into the upper block at the identical local coordinates within the 6x4 block (i.e., a cell at row r, column c measured from the top-left of the lower block is copied to row r, column c of the upper block) so the shape maintains its internal geometry and column positions.  \n6. Step 6: IF the recolored object has been copied into the upper block THEN set every cell in the entire grid that is color 2, color 6, or color 7 to color 0 (atomic action: change color to 0) so only color 0 and the newly placed color 8 remain.  \n7. Step 7: IF a final output is required THEN crop the grid to the upper block (the 6 rows above the separator, 6x4) and return that cropped 6x4 grid as the final output.\n",
