PATTERN: Each input color is consistently mapped to a fixed output color; vertical stripe positions and row repetition are preserved.\n3. KEY CHANGES:\nEx1: 5->1, 8->9, 6->2; stripes unchanged.\nEx2: 2->6, 3->4, 8->9; stripes unchanged.\nEx3: 9->8, 4->3, 2->6; stripes unchanged.\nEx4: 3->4, 1->5, 2->6; stripes unchanged.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT ===\nAll inputs are 3x3 with three vertical stripes; each row is identical. They differ only by which color fills each stripe (columns vary across examples).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT ===\nAll outputs keep 3x3 vertical-stripe layout with rows identical. Each column maps to a single output color consistently.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT ===\nA consistent color-to-color substitution is applied to every cell (layout unchanged): 5->1, 8->9, 6->2, 2->6, 3->4, 9->8, 4->3, 1->5.\n\nReference objects:\n- The three vertical stripe regions (positions) never move or change shape; they guide a column-wise replacement.\n\nGrid pattern:\n- Every cell color is replaced by a fixed partner color; spatial layout unchanged. Mapping is a swap of pairs.\n\nObjects:\n- The recurring objects are the three full-column stripes. Transformation = color-pair swap: 1?5, 2?6, 3?4, 8?9.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input is a 3x3 block (is a 3x3 grid) THEN preserve the spatial layout and shapes of all cells (do not move or reshape any cell), only recolor cells.\n\n2.
