PATTERN: Find the color that occurs exactly once and has the smallest row index (topmost unique); let its column be k; output the 2x2 block of rows 0–1 and columns (k-1,k) (use 0–1 if k=0).\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- EX1: topmost unique=2 at (0,3) → rows0–1 cols2–3 → [[8,2],[4,7]].\n- EX2: topmost unique=0 at (0,0) → rows0–1 cols0–1 → [[0,7],[5,6]].\n- EX3: topmost unique=0 at (1,1) → rows0–1 cols0–1 → [[5,8],[8,0]].\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Inputs vary in size and content but each contains at least one color that occurs exactly once. The chosen unique has the smallest row index; if several in that row, the rightmost (largest column) is chosen.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Every output is exactly a 2x2 contiguous subgrid taken from its input and always contains the chosen unique color.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: find the color that occurs exactly once with minimal row (tie → max col). Extract the 2x2 block from the input that contains that cell. Examples pick color 2 (ex1), 0 (ex2), 0 (ex3).\n\nReference objects: the color that occurs exactly once in the input — it anchors the selection.\n\nGrid pattern: always output a 2x2 subgrid. Choose the 2x2 block that contains the globally unique color and copy it without rotation (preserve relative orientation).\n\nObjects: the single-occurrence color and its immediate 2x2 neighborhood are the critical recurring elements; the transformation is \"extract the 2x2 containing the unique color.\"\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF the input grid contains at least one color that occurs exactly once THEN form set U = {color X | count(X) = 1} (mark each color that occurs exactly once as a candidate).\n\n2. Step 2: IF |U| > 1 THEN restrict U to only those candidate colors whose single-occurrence cell(s) have the minimal row index r_min (keep only candidates that occur in the topmost row among candidates).\n\n3. Step 3: IF more than one candidate remains in U with row = r_min THEN select the candidate whose single-occurrence cell has the maximal column index (rightmost) and name that color C located at coordinates (r,c) (discard the other candidates).\n\n4. Step 4: IF color C is selected at coordinates (r,c) THEN set target_columns = [c-1, c] if c > 0; otherwise set target_columns = [0,1] (choose the column pair that includes C, using columns 0 and 1 when C is in column 0).\n\n5. Step 5: IF target_columns are determined THEN set target_rows = [0,1] and extract the 2×2 subgrid formed by rows target_rows and columns target_columns preserving relative orientation and colors (produce that 2×2 block as the output, no rotation or recoloring).\n\n6. Step 6: IF any index in the chosen target_rows or target_columns would fall outside the input bounds THEN clamp the selection to the nearest valid contiguous pair of rows or columns (use rows [0,1] and for columns use [0,1] or [W-2,W-1] as needed) and then extract that 2×2 block preserving orientation.\n",
