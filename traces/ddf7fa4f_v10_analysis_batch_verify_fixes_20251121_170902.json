    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Grid size unchanged (10x10 → 10x10); each connected region of color 5 is recolored (1:1 object mapping).\n\n2. PATTERN: For every contiguous color-5 object replace 5 with the color of the single-cell marker in row 0 whose column lies above that object's horizontal center; markers and background (0) remain.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: 5→1 (left), 5→7 (right), 5→4 (bottom); row0 (1,4,7) keep.\n- Ex2: 5→2 (left), 5→6 (center), 5→8 (right); row0 (2,6,8) keep.\n- Ex3: 5→1 (left), 5→6 (center), 5→7 (right); row0 (1,6,7) keep.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Same: 10x10, black background, non-5 pixels (including single colored pixels in top row) persist.\n- Different: number, size and horizontal positions of distinct color-5 connected regions.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: top-row single pixels and all non-5 pixels unchanged. All outputs only recolor entire 5-regions to a single uniform color.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule that fits all: For each connected region of color 5, replace every 5 with the color of the single colored pixel in the top row whose column falls within (or nearest to) that region’s horizontal span.\n\nReference objects: the top-row single colored pixels (and all non-5 pixels) stay identical and act as color keys that guide recoloring.\n\nGrid pattern: keep 10x10; for every connected region of color 5, recolor the entire region with the color of the top-row colored pixel whose column is horizontally nearest (centroid/closest-x).\n\nObjects: recurring are connected color-5 blobs and the row-0 guide pixels; mapping is 1:1 by horizontal proximity.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a cell is in row 0 AND its color is not 0 AND its connected region size is 1 THEN leave that cell unchanged and record a color-key with the key's column = that cell's column and key color = that cell's color.  \nStep 2: IF a cell's color is not 5 (including the row-0 single pixels recorded as keys) THEN leave that cell unchanged.  \nStep 3: IF an object is a connected region whose color is 5 THEN compute the object's horizontal center column as round((min_col + max_col) / 2) where min_col and max_col are the object's bounding-box column indices.  \nStep 4: IF a 5-region has a computed horizontal center column C AND there exists one or more color-keys (from Step 1) at columns K_i THEN identify the key(s) with minimal distance |K_i - C|.  \nStep 5: IF a single color-key K_j is strictly nearest (minimal |K_i - C|) to the region's center C THEN change the color of every cell in that entire connected region of color 5 to the color of key K_j.  \nStep 6: IF two or more color-keys are tied for nearest distance to the region's center C THEN choose the tied key with the smaller column index (leftmost) and change the color of every cell in that entire connected region of color 5 to that leftmost tied key's color.  \nStep 7: IF no color-key exists in row 0 (no recorded keys) THEN leave all color-5 regions unchanged.  \nStep 8: IF the input grid has size 10x10 THEN preserve the grid dimensions and only perform the recolorings above (do not move or create pixels).\n",
