    "raw_analysis": "1. TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Each 3x3 input is expanded to 9x9 by replacing each input cell with a 3x3 block (scale factor 3).\n\n2. PATTERN THAT WORKS FOR ALL EXAMPLES: If an input cell is nonzero (color c) place a 3x3 copy of the entire original 3x3 input pattern (with its colors) into the corresponding 3x3 block; if input cell =0 place a 3x3 all-0 block.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: nonzero color 6 cells become 3x3 blocks copying the original 3x3 pattern (6/0); 0 -> zero blocks.\n- Ex2: color 4 cells spawn blocks reproducing original pattern; 0 remain empty.\n- Ex3: color 2 cells spawn blocks reproducing original pattern; 0 remain empty.\n- Ex4: color 2 cells spawn blocks reproducing original pattern; 0 remain empty.\n- Ex5: color 7 cells spawn blocks reproducing original pattern; 0 remain empty.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Key differences: color values differ (6,4,2,2,7) and which cells are nonzero vary.\n- What stays same: every input is 3x3 and contains a pattern of nonzero cells (same domain size).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly the same: each output is 9x9 tiled into 3x3 blocks. Blocks corresponding to zero input cells are all 0. Blocks for nonzero input cells contain a 3x3 copy of the entire input pattern recolored to that cell's color.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: each input cell at (i,j) expands to a 3x3 tile at rows 3i..3i+2, cols 3j..3j+2. If input(i,j)=0 the tile is all 0. If input(i,j)=c!=0 the tile is the original 3x3 input mask with its nonzero entries set to c.\n\nReference objects: the whole 3x3 input itself is the reference stencil — its pattern of nonzero cells is preserved and used to guide placement. Each nonzero input cell acts as a stamp using its own color.\n\nGrid pattern: divide output into nine 3x3 tiles (scale factor 3). For each input cell (i,j), if value v≠0, copy the entire 3x3 input pattern into tile (i,j) recolored to v; if 0 leave tile black.\n\nObjects: the key object is the input's nonzero shape (the stencil) and each colored cell (the stampers) which are repeatedly placed at tile positions.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF the input grid is a 3x3 grid THEN create an output grid of size 9x9 and initialize every cell of the 9x9 output to color 0.  \nStep 2: IF a cell in the input is at row r and column c (0-indexed) THEN identify the corresponding 3x3 tile in the output as the block of rows 3*r through 3*r+2 and columns 3*c through 3*c+2.  \nStep 3: IF an input cell at (r,c) has color 0 THEN set every cell in the corresponding 3x3 output tile (rows 3*r..3*r+2, cols 3*c..3*c+2) to color 0.  \nStep 4: IF an input cell at (r,c) has a nonzero color v (v != 0) THEN prepare to fill the corresponding 3x3 output tile (rows 3*r..3*r+2, cols 3*c..3*c+2) by stamping the entire 3x3 input pattern into that tile.  \nStep 5: IF stamping the entire 3x3 input pattern into a tile for a nonzero input cell color v THEN for each cell of the 3x3 input pattern: if the pattern cell's color w is 0 leave the corresponding cell in the tile as 0, and if w != 0 set the corresponding cell in the tile to v (replace every nonzero w by v).  \nStep 6: IF there are multiple input cells with v != 0 THEN apply Steps 2–5 independently for each such input cell so each nonzero input cell produces its own recolored 3x3 stamped tile in the corresponding output location.  \nStep 7: IF all input cells have been processed according to the above rules THEN return the completed 9x9 output grid.\n",
