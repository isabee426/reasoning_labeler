Singletons (1,4,7) and 0 stay.\n- Ex2: 5-region cols4-7 rows2-5 → 6; cols1-2 rows4-8 → 2; cols7-9 rows7-9 → 8. Singletons (2,6,8) and 0 stay.\n- Ex3: 5-region cols1-2 rows2-4 → 1; cols3-5 rows5-7 → 6; cols7-9 rows3-4 → 7. Singletons (1,6,7) and 0 stay.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All inputs: several distinct connected regions of color 5; three single-pixel colored labels on row0 at different columns; rest background and other colored rectangles identical.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- All outputs: top row labels unchanged; non-5 pixels same as inputs; every 5-region preserved in shape/position but recolored.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Rule: each distinct color-5 region is replaced by the color of the single-pixel on row0 whose column overlaps that region (use top-row color: e.g. 1,4,7 / 2,6,8 / 1,6,7).\n\nReference objects: The three single-pixel colored labels in row 0 remain unchanged and serve as the color keys, ordered by their column positions.\n\nGrid pattern: Sort the distinct connected regions of color 5 left-to-right and map them to the top-row labels left-to-right. Recolor each entire 5-region with its matched label color.\n\nObjects: The recurring objects are separate color-5 blobs; their horizontal order (centroid/leftmost) is the critical feature.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a pixel is located in row 0 AND its color is not 0 AND it has no orthogonally adjacent pixel of the same color (i.e., is a single-pixel region) THEN mark that pixel as a top-row label and do not change its color.  \nStep 2: IF a set of pixels forms a connected region by 4-neighbor connectivity AND every pixel in that region has color 5 THEN treat that connected region as a distinct color-5 object and determine its bounding box and leftmost column (minimum column index of its pixels).  \nStep 3: IF one or more top-row label pixels have been marked (from Step 1) THEN order those label pixels by ascending column index (leftmost → rightmost) to produce a label sequence L1, L2, …, Ln where each Li has color Ci.  \nStep 4: IF one or more distinct color-5 objects have been identified (from Step 2) THEN order those color-5 objects by ascending leftmost column to produce a region sequence R1, R2, …, Rm.  \nStep 5: IF a region Rk exists and there is a label Lk at the same ordinal position k in the label sequence (i.e., the k-th left-to-right 5-region and the k-th left-to-right top-row label) THEN change the color of every pixel in region Rk from 5 to the color Ck of label Lk.  \nStep 6: IF a pixel is not part of any color-5 region (its color ≠ 5) THEN leave that pixel’s color unchanged.\n",
