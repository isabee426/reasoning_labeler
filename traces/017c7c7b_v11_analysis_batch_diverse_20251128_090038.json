PATTERN: For all examples, keep row order and pixels but recolor 1 to 2, then append the top third (first 3 rows) to the bottom, producing 9 rows.\n\n3. KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: identical row sequence, 1→2, rows1–3 appended as rows7–9.\n- Ex2: same; shape preserved, 1→2, rows1–3 appended.\n- Ex3: same; 1→2, rows1–3 appended.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT ===\n- All inputs 6x3, background 0 and foreground 1; same vertical-stroke motif. Row order and pixel positions are preserved; they differ in which rows contain the horizontal arm (pattern shifts).\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT ===\n- All outputs 9x3, color 1→2 (0 unchanged). In every output the first six rows are the input recolored exactly; rows 7–9 are a copy of some contiguous 3-row block from that recolored input.\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT ===\n- Common rule: recolor 1→2 and enlarge height 6→9 by appending a copied contiguous triple of input rows to the bottom.\n\n- Reference objects: the single connected vertical stroke(s) (center column plus any left/right protrusions) stay the same shape and horizontal position; they are the anchor for the transform.\n\n- Grid pattern: global vertical scale ×1.5 (6→9), width fixed, color 1→2, background 0 unchanged. Row order and pixel columns preserved.\n\n- Objects: recurring object = the vertical stroke and T‑like protrusions; they are vertically elongated by repeating rows (expanding each local 2‑row pattern into 3 rows) to reach 9 rows.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\nStep 1: IF a cell's color is 1 THEN change that cell's color to 2.  \nStep 2: IF the input grid has height = 6 AND width = 3 THEN keep rows 0..5 (the six input rows) in the same order (after applying Step 1).  \nStep 3: IF a row r in the original input satisfies (cell(r,0) = 1 OR cell(r,2) = 1) THEN label row r as a \"horizontal-arm\" row (this detects any row that has a 1 in a side column).  \nStep 4: IF there are one or more \"horizontal-arm\" rows then choose a single row r* as follows: compute the vertical center reference c = (height/2 - 0.5) (for height=6 this is 2.5); pick r* as the horizontal-arm row with minimal |r - c|; IF two or more horizontal-arm rows tie for minimal distance THEN pick the topmost (smallest r) among the tied rows.  \nStep 5: IF r* is selected THEN identify the contiguous 3-row block B = rows [r*-1, r*, r*+1] from the recolored grid (Step 1). When any index in B would be out of bounds, clamp that index to the nearest existing row (so if r*-1 < 0 use row 0, if r*+1 > height-1 use row height-1).  \nStep 6: IF block B is identified THEN append block B (in the same column order) to the bottom of the preserved six recolored rows (from Step 2), producing a final grid of height 9 and width 3.  \nStep 7: IF any appended row was produced by clamping (because r* was at an edge) THEN, after appending, ensure the final height is 9 by repeating the nearest existing appended row(s) as needed (repeat the nearest appended row once) so that the final grid has exactly three appended rows.\n\nExplanation note (implicit in the steps): Steps 1–2 recolor every 1→2 and keep the original 6 rows. Steps 3–6 detect the row that contains a horizontal protrusion (a side 1), select the one closest to the vertical center (tie → topmost), take the 3-row neighborhood centered on that row (with bounds clamped), and append that 3-row neighborhood to the bottom of the recolored 6 rows to make a 9×3 output.\n",
