    "raw_analysis": "1) TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Output keeps size 7x7 (1:1); the small diagonal staircase of three nonzero colors is extracted then tiled to fill the full grid.\n\n2) PATTERN: For all examples read the 3-color diagonal as a cycle [c0,c1,c2]; output cell = cycle[(row+col) mod 3], producing a repeating 3-color lattice.\n\n3) KEY CHANGES:\n- Ex1: input diagonal colors {1,2,4} -> cycle [2,4,1]; zeros removed; grid tiled with those numbers.\n- Ex2: input diagonal {2,8,3} -> cycle [2,8,3]; zeros replaced by repeating pattern.\n- Ex3: input diagonal {4,8,3} -> cycle [4,8,3]; same tiling applied.\n\n=== INPUT-INPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Key differences: staircase location/orientation and extra irrelevant objects (ex3 has an extra yellow diagonal). Colors themselves differ per example.\n- Same: each input contains exactly three nonzero colors arranged as a small connected diagonal/staircase of length 3.\n\n=== OUTPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Exactly same: a full 7x7 fill using only those three input colors, tiled with period 3 so each row is a cyclic shift (a 3x3 repeating pattern).\n\n=== INPUT-OUTPUT COMPARISONS ===\n- Transformation: extract the 3-color diagonal/staircase (the three nonzero colors: ex1 {1,2,4}, ex2 {2,8,3}, ex3 {4,8,3}) and tile that 3-color sequence across the 7x7 grid in a 3-periodic cyclic pattern.\n\nReference objects: The connected diagonal \"staircase\" of three nonzero colors is invariant and used as the template; small extra objects are ignored.\n\nGrid pattern: Extract that 3-color diagonal motif and tile it periodically to fill the 7x7, producing a 3-color repeating/checker pattern (rows are cyclic shifts).\n\nObjects: Most important = the 3-cell diagonal trio (color sequence/order). Recurring pattern = the 3-color repeating motif; all else is irrelevant.\n\n=== GENERAL RULE ===\n1. Step 1: IF there exists a connected region made of exactly three nonzero cells that are orthogonally adjacent and form a 3-cell diagonal/staircase (i.e., cells occupying positions (r,c), (r+1,c-1), (r+2,c-2) OR (r,c), (r+1,c+1), (r+2,c+2)) THEN identify that region as the template and label its cells in order from the smallest row (topmost) to largest row (bottommost) as colors c0, c1, c2 (each ci is the numeric color value found in the input). \n2. Step 2: IF a template [c0,c1,c2] has been identified THEN ignore all other nonzero connected objects and treat them as irrelevant for pattern generation (do not use their colors when creating the output).\n3. Step 3: IF a template [c0,c1,c2] is defined THEN set the output grid size equal to the input grid size (preserve the 7x7 dimensions) before filling colors.\n4. Step 4: IF a cell has coordinates (r,c) such that (r + c) mod 3 = 0 THEN set that output cell's color to c0.\n5. Step 5: IF a cell has coordinates (r,c) such that (r + c) mod 3 = 1 THEN set that output cell's color to c1.\n6. Step 6: IF a cell has coordinates (r,c) such that (r + c) mod 3 = 2 THEN set that output cell's color to c2.\n7. Step 7: IF any cell would otherwise be 0 or a color not in {c0,c1,c2} in the output THEN replace it with the color determined by Steps 4-6 so that the final output contains only the three template colors c0, c1, c2 in the 3-period repeating lattice.\n",
